        "Proof of equivalence: let ord(a,k) be the multiplicative of a modulo k. First we notice that all terms are congruent to 3 modulo 4, since -4 is a quadratic residue modulo p if p == 1 (mod 4). If ord(4,p) = (p-1)/2. Note that (p-1)/2 is odd, so it is coprime to ord(-1,p) = 2. As a result, ord(-4,p) = ((p-1)/2) * 2 = p-1. Conversely, If ord(-4,p) = p-1, we must have ord(4,p) = (p-1)/2 by noting that ord(-4,p) <= lcm(2,ord(4,p)).",
        "Also primes p such that the multiplicative order of 16 modulo p is (p-1)/2. Proof: note that ord(16,p) = ord(-4,p)/gcd(ord(-4,p),2). If ord(-4,p) = p-1, then ord(16,p) = (p-1)/2. Conversely, if ord(16,p) = (p-1)/2, then ord(-4,p) = p-1, since otherwise ord(-4,p) = (p-1)/2 is odd, which is impossible since that -4 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime p == 3 (mod 4).",
