        "The maximum sextuple density is the triple sextuple where each member is +0, +210, +420; there is currently only one known example of a triple sextuple. These are the \"failed\" triples where the members are +0, +420, or more exactly: p + d, d = [0, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16] + 420n, n = 0..1.",
        "The maximum density of prime sextuples is the triple of form p + d, d = [0, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16] + 210n, n = 0..2. The first triple prime sextuple is 50038627250687303646277 (from Waldvogel and Leikauf link). While investigating triple sextuples it becomes apparent of the need for failed, or \"cousin\" sextuples; i.e., when the middle triple sextuple member is not a sextuple."
