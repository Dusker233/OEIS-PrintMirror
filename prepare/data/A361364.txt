    "comment": [
        "In Novak's note it is mentioned that if P(z) and Q(z) are the g.f.s for the probabilities of indecomposable and decomposable loops, respectively, that P(z) = 1 - 1/Q(z). This works equally well using loop counts rather than probabilities. The g.f.s may be expressed by the series constructed from the sequences of counts of loops of length 2*n. Q(z) for the 5-d case is the series corresponding to A287317.",
        "To satisfy this g.f. equation, a(0) should be 0, but we give it as 1 since there is one trivial loop of 0 steps, and for consistency with related sequences.",
        "To obtain the probability of returning to the point of origin for the first time after 2*n steps, divide a(n) by the total number of walks of length 2*n in d dimensions: (2*d)^(2*n) = 100^n."
