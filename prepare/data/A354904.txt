        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.",
        "Every sequence can be uniquely split into a sequence of non-overlapping runs. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are ((2,2),(1,1,1),(3),(2,2)), with sums (4,3,3,4).",
        "The first term k such that the k-th composition in standard order does not have ones sandwiching the same prime number an even number of times is k = 3221, corresponding to the composition (1,3,3,2,2,1)."
