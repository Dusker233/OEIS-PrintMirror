        "The only primes p such that p^10 - 1 has fewer than A309906(10)=256 divisors are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 43.",
        "p^10 - 1 = (p-1)*(p+1)*(p^4 - p^3 + p^2 - p + 1)*(p^4 + p^3 + p^2 + p + 1). For every p > 11, one of these five factors is divisible by 11; one of p-1 and p+1 is divisible by 3; and p-1 and p+1 are consecutive even numbers, so one of them is divisible by 4 and their product is divisible by 8; thus, p^10 - 1 is divisible by 2^3 * 3 * 11.",
