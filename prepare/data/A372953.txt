        "The multiplication group of GF(p^n) is cyclic of order o = p^n-1. For p=2, 1=-1, so 1 is a square root of -1. Otherwise, -1 has order 2 and so any square root of -1 has order 4. So, for there to be a square root of -1, o mod 4 must be 0, i.e. p^n mod 4 = 1. Then if g is a generator of the group, g^(o/4) is a square root of -1. p^n mod 4 = 1 if and only if p mod 4 = 1 or p mod 4 = 3 and n is even."
