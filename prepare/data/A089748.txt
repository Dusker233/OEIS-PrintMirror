        "There are two sets of candidates of k: (i) k|A001065(k) and k|A007956(k) individually, or (ii) neither k|A001065(k) nor k|A007956(k) but the remainders of A001065(k)/k and A007956(k)/k sum up to k. If k has at least 4 divisors, the product of the second and penultimate divisor (in the sorted divisors list) is k, so k|A007956(k). This means for all k in A080257 we have k|A007956(k), and the k that do not divide A007956(k) are in A000430, which means k=p or k=p^2 for some prime p. If k=p, A001065(k)+A007956(k) = 1+1 =2, and the requirement here reduces to k|2 and only k=2 is left. If k=p^2, A001065(k) +A007956(k) = 1+p+p = 1+2*p, and the requirement here reduces to p^2 | (1+2*p), which has no solutions. This means case (ii) does not generate any solutions besides k=2. And this means all other solutions are from case (i), and therefore elements A007691 > 1 are the only remaining candidates. - _R. J. Mathar_, Oct 15 2021"
