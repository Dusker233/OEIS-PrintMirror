    "comment": [
        "A multiset is aperiodic if its multiplicities are relatively prime.",
        "Also the number of nonnegative integer symmetric matrices up to row and column permutations with sum of elements equal to n and no zero rows or columns, with relatively prime row sums (or column sums) and no row or column having a common divisor > 1.",
        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.",
        "The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices."
