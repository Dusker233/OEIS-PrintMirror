        "Old name was \"The first number of a series of 5 consecutive numbers with the same signature, i.e., all numbers have the format p^2*q, where p and q are primes. Therefore the number of divisors is the same (6).\" [That name could have been confusing in that not every sequence of 5 consecutive integers having the same prime signature has the prime signature p^2*q; e.g., 204323 is the first of 5 consecutive numbers of the form p^2*q*r. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jun 05 2018]",
        "Each of the five numbers in each such sequence has 6 divisors.",
        "It is easy to prove that any number in this sequence must be congruent to 1 modulo 240. The program below calculates only an element of the sequence. Since the reference A119479 it is the smallest one. If we assume that the first element has the format 7^2*n49, the second number has the format 2*p^2, the third element has the format 3^2*n9 and the fifth element has the format 5^2*n25, then p must be modulo 22050 one out of 1181, 3719, 4219, 9119, 12931, 17831, 18331 or 20869.",
