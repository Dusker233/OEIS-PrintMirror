        "No term may have a digit 0 or 1, therefore the asymptotic density is zero and would be so even if the definition is changed to \"digits 0 are allowed but ignored\", since pandigital numbers A171102 have asymptotic density 1.",

Also no multiples of 2 or 5 (A005843 or A008587) which are even modulo the last digit (unless it is 0), so all terms end in 3, 7 or 9.",
