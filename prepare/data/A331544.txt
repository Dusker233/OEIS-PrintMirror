        "Heuristic justification: Consider that e = 2 + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ... We always have at least two values in a run. The odds of there being a third value = 1/2!. The odds of there being a fourth value = 1/3! (because there are exactly 3! ways to sort three differences, and only one of these ways is in increasing order). And so on. The process is aberrated by the possibility of equal increases. This sequence disallows equal increases in the runs, causing the convergence to e to approach from below. However, as the scale increases, these equal increases occur less frequently and their effect approaches zero. The sister sequence, \"Primes that begin a run of consecutive primes whose first differences are nondecreasing\", includes equal increases in its rows, thus it approaches e from above. Averaging the runs of the two sequences should negate the aberration, giving immediate convergence to e. This convergence is however slowed by the natural increase of prime gaps as the primes grow larger, and the average run length remains slightly below e with extensive calculation.",
        "The probability that a randomly chosen integer n is prime is approximately 1/log(n) (by the prime number theorem). Thus, the expected gap between consecutive primes of size k is approximately (1/log(n)) * (1 - 1/log(n))^k - 1.",
        "Using the above formula, we can calculate the expected length of the k-th set as follows:",
        "E(length of k-th set) = Sum_{n>=m+1} ((1/log(n)) * (1 - 1/log(n))^k - 1) where m is the largest prime less than or equal to the starting prime of the k-th set.",
