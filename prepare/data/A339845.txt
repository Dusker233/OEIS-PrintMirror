        "In the covering case, these degree sequences, sorted in decreasing order, are the same thing as loop-graphical partitions (A339656). An integer partition is loop-graphical if it comprises the multiset of vertex-degrees of some graph with loops, where a loop is an edge with two equal vertices.",

        "(1) the prime indices of n can be partitioned into distinct pairs, i.e. into a set of loops and edges;",
        "(2) n can be factored into distinct semiprimes;",
        "(3) the prime signature of n is loop-graphical."
