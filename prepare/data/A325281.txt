        "Also numbers whose adjusted frequency depth is one plus their number of prime factors counted with multiplicity. The adjusted frequency depth of a positive integer n is 0 if n = 1, and otherwise it is one plus the number of times one must apply A181819 to reach a prime number, where A181819(k = p^i*...*q^j) = prime(i)*...*prime(j) = product of primes indexed by the prime exponents of k. For example, 180 has adjusted frequency depth 5 because we have: 180 -> 18 -> 6 -> 4 -> 3.",
        "The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k), so these are Heinz numbers of integer partitions whose adjusted frequency depth is equal to their length plus 1. The enumeration of these partitions by sum is given by A127002."
