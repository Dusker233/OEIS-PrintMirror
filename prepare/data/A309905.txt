        "In p-adic field, the exponential function exp(x) is defined as Sum_{k>=0} x^k/k!. When extended to a function over the metric completion of the p-adic field, exp(x) has radius of convergence p^(-1/(p-1)) (i.e., exp(x) converges for x such that |x|_p < p^(-1/(p-1)), where |x|_p is the p-adic metric). As a result, for odd primes p, exp(p) is well-defined in p-adic field, and exp(4) is well defined in 2-adic field.",
