        "It is conjectured that this sequence is infinite, and that similar lists of primes can be generated by using any even number of consecutive primes.  Specifying 2 consecutive primes results in A096342.  However, it should be noted that the percentage of resulting primes (as compared to all numbers generated in this manner) decreases as the number of consecutive primes to consider increases."
