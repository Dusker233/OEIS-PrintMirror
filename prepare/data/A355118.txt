    "name": "The number of nonequivalent root ancestral configurations in a recursively defined family of gene trees and species trees with at least n = 9 leaves, in which for n >= 12 leaves, 3-leaf trees are successively added at the root of the tree with n-3 leaves.",
    "comment": [
        "a(n) is the number of nonequivalent root ancestral configurations associated with a sequence of pairs (G(n), S(n)), where G(n) is a gene tree and S(n) is a bijectively labeled species tree, G(n) and S(n) both have n leaves, and G(n) = S(n). The sequence of pairs possesses certain (binary, rooted) trees for n = 9, n = 10, and n = 11, as shown in Figure 5 of Disanto and Rosenberg (2019); for n >= 12, the tree G(n) = S(n) is formed by appending the tree G(n-3) and a 3-leaf binary rooted tree to a shared root.",
        "For 9 <= n <= 20, a(n) tabulates the number of nonequivalent root ancestral configurations for the pair (G, S) with the largest number of nonequivalent root ancestral configurations (among pairs with n leaves and G = S). Disanto and Rosenberg (2019) conjecture that a(n) provides this maximum for all n >= 9."
