        "This is a generalization of A056826. Note that (n^n+1)/(n+1) = cyclotomic(2n,n) when n is prime. These are probable primes for n > 352. No others < 4700.",
        "All terms of this sequence that are greater than 3 are congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4. In general, if k = s^2*t where t is squarefree and t == 2, 3 (mod 4), then Cyclotomic(2k,t*x^2) is the product of two polynomials. See the Wikipedia link below. - _Jianing Song_, Sep 25 2019"
