        "For example, the string AABABBBCCC colors a bracelet of 10 beads using 3 symbols. No two beads have the same color and neighbors with the same set of colors. In this problem, the order in which the neighbors' colors occur doesn't matter (because the bracelet can be turned over). So the string ABBABCBCAC wouldn't work, because we can't distinguish between the second and third beads (ABB and BBA). We can't do this with only 2 colors, so a(10) = 3."
