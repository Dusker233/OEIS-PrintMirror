    "comment": [
        "The Lucas cube Lambda(n) can be defined as the graph whose vertices are the binary strings of length n without either two consecutive 1's or a 1 in the first and in the last position, and in which two vertices are adjacent when their Hamming distance is exactly 1.",
        "The second multiplicative Zagreb index of a simple connected graph is product(deg(x)^(deg(x)) over all the vertices of the graph (see, for example, the I. Gutman reference, p. 16).",
        "In the Maple program G = Sum_{n>=0} P[n]z^n is the generating function of the Lucas cubes according to size (coded by z) and vertex degrees (coded by t). See the Klavzar - Mollard - Petkovsek reference: l(x,y) on p. 1321 with different variables."
