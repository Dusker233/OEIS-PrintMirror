        "I am no expert at sequences, but my work is forcing me to be. I need only an equation to represent this sequence and I believe I will have completed my goal, as well as found a new approximation technique for square roots. It views them in a whole new way and should prove interesting to more formal mathematicians. This work has taken me 2.5 years and I would appreciate any help in its finalization.",
