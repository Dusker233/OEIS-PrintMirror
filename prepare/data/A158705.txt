        "The nonnegative integers with an even number of even powers of 2 in their base-2 representation are given in A158704.",
        "It appears that a result similar to Prouhet's theorem holds for the terms of A158704 and A158705, specifically: Sum_{k=0..2^n-1, k has an even number of even powers of 2} k^j = Sum_{k=0..2^n-1, k has an odd number of even powers of 2} k^j, for 0 <= j <= (n-1)/2. For a recent treatment of this theorem, see the reference.",
        "Take any binary vector of length 4n+1 with n >= 0. We can activate any bits. When a bit is activated, neighboring bits change their values 0 -> 1, 1 -> 0. Our goal is to turn the original binary vector into a vector of only ones by activating the bits. If the value of the binary vector belongs to this sequence, this is possible for a maximum of 4n+1 activations. - _Mikhail Kurkov_, Jun 03 2021"
