        "Let Sum* be a special summation procedure carried out on the binary expansions of each of the decimal values produced by the following expression for all distinct prime factors of n. That is, when 'adding' the various binary expansions of said decimal results for each p dividing n, p prime, allow that 1 + q + r + ... + s = 1, and 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. Then, Sum*_{p|n} 2^(p-1) * ((2^p+1) * 2^(n-p) - 2)/(2^p - 1) + 1, when reverted to decimal, gives a(n).",
