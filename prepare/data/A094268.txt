        "The triple 171078830, 171078831, 171078832 was apparently found by Laurent Hodges and Michael Reid in 1995.",
        "The starting term of the smallest consecutive 4-tuple of abundant numbers is at most 141363708067871564084949719820472453374 - Bruno Mishutka (bruno.mishutka(AT)googlemail.com), Nov 01 2007",
        "Paul Erd\u0151s showed that there are two absolute constants c1, c2 such that for all large n there are at least c1 log log log n but not more than c2 log log log n consecutive abundant numbers less than n. - Bruno Mishutka (bruno.mishutka(AT)googlemail.com), Nov 01 2007",
        "The term a(0) = 0 is included to avoid the warning messages triggered by sequences with fewer than four terms. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 07 2007",
        "From _Jianing Song_, Apr 10 2021: (Start)",
        "a(n) exists for all n. Proof: since the infinite product Product_{p prime} (1 + 1/p) diverges, we can find a strictly increasing sequence {b(m)} such that b(0) = 0, Product_{k=b(m)+1..b(m+1)} (1 + 1/prime(k)) > 2 for all m. Given n, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find N such that N + m divides Product_{k=b(m)+1..b(m+1)} prime(k) for m = 0..n-1, then sigma(N + m)/(N + m) >= Product_{k=b(m)+1..b(m+1)} (1 + 1/prime(k)) > 2.",
        "For example, if N is divisible by 2*3*5, N+1 is divisible by 7*11*...*73, N+2 is divisible by 79*83*...*7499, N+3 is divisible by 7507*7517*...*57081677, N+4 is divisible by 57081679*57081697*...*(some very large prime), then N through N+4 are consecutive abundant numbers.",
        "Of course, the number N found using this method will be extremely large, since Product_{k=1..K} (1 + 1/prime(k)) ~ log(log(K)). (End)"
