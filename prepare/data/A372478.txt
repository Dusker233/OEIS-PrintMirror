        "This is a variation of A372101 in which the hydra grows new subtrees instead of  new heads. See Kirby and Paris (1982), p. 286, for a detailed explanation (with diagrams) of this process, for a generic hydra.",
        "Similar to A372101, the initial configuration of this specific hydra is a path with n segments. The rightmost head is the next to be chopped off. When this happens at step s, s new replicas of the subtree above the removed head's grandparent node (which includes the segment connecting the head's parent and grandparent) sprout to the right of the grandparent node. If the chopped head has no grandparent, no subtrees are added.",
