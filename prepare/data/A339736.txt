        "Without the digit 0 requirement, every number greater than one could be represented in base 2 with more than one digit and would contain the digit 1. Without the single-digit requirement, every number m greater than zero could be represented as \"m\" in base m+1.",
        "From _Alex Stefanov_, Sep 13 2021: (Start)",
        "The sequence appears to be infinite. Every term other than a(1)=1 is even because every odd number 2k+1 can be represented as \"1k\" in base k+1 (for k>0).",
        "Every term is 1 less than a prime number because, for all numbers m, if m+1 is not prime then, in base b = largest divisor of m+1, m is a two digit number ending in b-1 (since m+1 is a two digit number ending in 0), thus proving m is not in the sequence. (End)"
