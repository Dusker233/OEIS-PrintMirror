        "Earls (2005) noted that if m > 2 is a solution to abs(K(m+1) - K(m)) = 1 (A346211) then either m or m+1 is nonsquarefree (A013929), and asked whether there are any solutions with both m and m+1 being squarefree.",
        "There are no such solutions below 10^9.",
        "Since there are also no solutions to K(m) = K(m+1) below 10^9, it can be conjectured that the minimal difference abs(K(m+1) - K(m)) between consecutive numbers m and m+1 that are both squarefree is 2.",
