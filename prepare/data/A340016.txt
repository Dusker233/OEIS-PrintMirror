        "The permutation A109812 has regions with smaller amplitude of A109812(n) - n in relative proximity to values of A305370 (Index of 2^n in A109812), this causes higher probability of fixed points in these regions.",
        "The permutation A109812 has only weak selfsimilarity and increases its complexity with each interval 2^m..2^(m+1), by this increasing complexity it will be extremely difficult to find any rules and proofs regarding fixed points."
