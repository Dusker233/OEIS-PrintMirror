    "comment": [
        "For an n-prism, formed from two n-sided regular polygons joined by n adjacent rectangles, create all possible internal planes defined by connecting any three of its vertices. For example, in the case of a triangular prism this results in 6 planes. Use all the resulting planes to cut the prism into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the number of resulting polyhedra for prisms with n>=3.",
