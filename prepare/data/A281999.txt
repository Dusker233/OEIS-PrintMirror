    "comment": [
        "The curves Y = X^m are characterized by the fact that the first derivative Y'= m*X^(m-1) (and all the following derivatives) are squarable in the integers by rectangular columns called gnomons with base=1 and height M_m = X^m - (X-1)^m. Calling Y' = X^m - (X-1)^m the first \"integer\" derivative, considering the case m=5, {a(n)} represents the values of half of the maximum (right) height of the trapezoidal gnomons. The formula is: a(n) = (n^5 - (n-1)^5) - a(n-1). The broken line given by joining the points (n; 2*a(n)); define a series of trapezoidal areas (gnomons) that have the same area below the curve Y'=5*X^4. It means that the recursive sum of the trapezoidal gnomon's area, (a(n) + a(n-1))*1, from 1 to n, gives n^5.",
        "The general formula, changing the exponent for all the Y = X^m curves, gives infinitely many new sequences: b(m,k) = m^k - (m-1)^k - b(m-1,k). The same can be done for all the following derivatives. For the smallest exponents k of Y = X^k the sequences are known: for k=3 the sequence is A032528, for k=4 the sequence is A007588, and k=5 corresponds to this sequence."
