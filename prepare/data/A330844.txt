        "One continuous third of the perimeter of a Koch snowflake tile at step n+1 coincides with one sixth of the perimeter of an adjacent Koch snowflake tile at step n; this is the maximum matching that can be achieved with the given scaling and rotation parameters (see illustration of two adjacent Koch snowflakes at consecutive steps in Links section).",
