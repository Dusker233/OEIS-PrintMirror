        "Note that 504 = 7*8*9. For odd prime we have p^2 == 1 (mod 8). By Fermat's theorem and Euler's totient theorem we have p^6 == 1 (mod 7) for p != 7 and p^6 == 1 (mod 9) for p != 3. So 504 divides p^6 - 1 for p != 2, 3, 7.",

And also, for any prime q != 2, 3, 7, by Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, there exists a prime p of the form k*q + d with d^6 == 1 (mod p), 0 < d < q. Since gcd(q,504) = 1, we have p^6 == d^6 == 1 (mod 504*q), so q is divisible by (p^6 - 1)/504.",
