        "A balanced collection, a.k.a. a balanced set, is a collection of subsets of a ground set N together with a system of weights such that, for any element i of N, the sum of the weights associated with the subsets containing i is one. A minimal balanced collection is a minimal (w.r.t. inclusion) element among the balanced collections.",
