    "comment": [
        "This is the q=1 member of the q-family of sequences F_q(n), defined as the number of (n+2q) X (n+2q) symmetric matrices with nonnegative integer entries, trace 0, with n rows that sum to 2, and 2q rows that sum to 1. It is relevant to the counting of dipole graphs as is discussed in the paper whose link is given below. The q=0 member of this family is the sequence A002137."
