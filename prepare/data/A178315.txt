        "Number of equivalence classes of graphs on n vertices, where two graphs are in the same class if one can be obtained from the other by loop-switching a subset of its connected components. Here, loop-switching is a fixed-point-free involution adding a loop to every vertex that doesn't have one while simultaneously deleting the loops from all vertices that do. (see MO link)",
        "Also, number of balanced signed graphs (without loops) on n vertices. A graph is signed if every edge has a sign, either positive or negative, and it is balanced if every cycle has an even number of negative edges. (see MO link)",
        "Also, number of graphs on vertices {1,2,...,n}  with loops allowed, where the least vertex in each component has a loop. (see MO link)"
