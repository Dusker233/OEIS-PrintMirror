        "The function s_g(m) gives the sum of the base-g digits of m.",
        "The sequence is infinite, since it contains A324460.",
        "The sequence also contains the 3-Carmichael numbers A087788 and the primary Carmichael numbers A324316.",
        "A term m must have at least 2 prime factors, and the divisor g satisfies the inequalities 1 < g < m^(1/(ord_g(m)+1)) <= sqrt(m), where ord_g(m) gives the maximum exponent e such that g^e divides m.",
        "Note that the sequence contains the 3-Carmichael numbers, but not all Carmichael numbers. This is a nontrivial fact.",
        "The subsequence A324460 mainly gives examples in which g is composite.",
        "See Kellner 2019.",
        "It appears that g is usually prime: compare with A324857 (g prime) and the sparser sequence A324858 (g composite). However, g is usually composite for higher values of m. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Mar 17 2019"
