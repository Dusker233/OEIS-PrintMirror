    "comment": [
        "Trapping occurs if the walk cannot be continued without reusing an already visited field or creating an intersection of the path segments formed by straight lines connecting consecutively visited fields.",
        "The shortest self-trapped walk has 4 moves, i.e., a(n)=0 for n < 4."

        "a(4) = 1 because there is only one trapped walk of 4 moves, written in algebraic chess notation: (N) b1 d2 b3 a1 c2.",
