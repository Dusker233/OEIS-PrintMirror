        "The subgroup is one of 8 A059897(.,.) subgroups of the form {k : A007913(k) == 1 (mod m)}. The list seems complete, in anticipation of proof that such sets form subgroups only when m is a divisor of 24 (based on the property described by A. G. Astudillo in A018253). This sequence might be viewed as primitive with respect to the other 7, as the latter correspond to subgroups of its quotient group, in the sense that each one (as a set) is also a union of cosets described below. The 7 include A003159 (m=2), A055047 (m=3), A277549 (m=4), A234000 (m=8) and the trivial A000027 (m=1).",
        "The subgroup has 32 cosets. For each i in {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}, j in {1, 2, 3, 6} there is a coset {n : n = k^2 * (24m + i) * j, k >= 1, m >= 0}. The divisors of 2730 = 2*3*5*7*13 form a transversal. (11, clearly not such a divisor, is in the same coset as 35 = 11 + 24; 17, 19, 23 are in the same cosets as 65, 91, 455 respectively.)",
