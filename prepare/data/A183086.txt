        "Supersequence of A134970. The structure of digits represents a canyon (a deep valley between cliffs). The first digits are in decreasing order. The last digits are in increasing order. There is only one smaller digit which represents the bottom of the canyon. But the restriction that both cliffs are at same level (first digit equal to the final digit) is dropped here.",
