    "comment": [
        "The instructions of this two-register counting machine are to be interpreted as follows: Two registers are initialized to zero, and the instruction pointer starts on the first instruction. i[k] means increment the k-th register. The instruction pointer then moves to the next instruction. d[k,l] means decrement the k-th register if it is nonzero, and then change the instruction pointer to l. Otherwise move the instruction pointer to the next instruction. The following set of 8 instructions is given in the book 'A New Kind of Science' by Stephen Wolfram as one of the simplest register machines which has complex behavior: {i[1], i[1], i[1], d[2,1], d[1,6], i[2], d[1,5], d[2,3]}. This sequence distills information about the states of the register machine by including only the values of the first register, at those times when the 2nd register has just been decremented to zero."
