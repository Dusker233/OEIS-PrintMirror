        "A number k is in the sequence iff in its prime factorization, all primes == 1 (mod 3) occur to odd powers, and all primes == 2 (mod 3) occur to even powers. (3 can occur to any power.) This sequence is similar but not identical to many others; in particular, 343 is in this sequence, but not in A034022.",
