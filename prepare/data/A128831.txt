        "The general formula where each entry is chosen from the subsets of {1,..,k} is (2^n-1)^k. This may be shown by exhibiting a bijection to a set whose cardinality is obviously (2^n-1)^k, namely the set of all k-tuples with each entry chosen from the 2^n-1 proper subsets of {1,..,n}, i.e. for of the k entries {1,..,n} is forbidden. The bijection is given by (X_1,..,X_n) |-> (Y_1,..,Y_k) where for each j in {1,..,k} and each i in {1,..,n}, i is in Y_j if and only if j is in X_i. Sequence A060867 is the case where the entries are chosen from subsets of {1,2}."
