        "Given the complete set of pentagonal polyiamonds and a tiling program, all possible pentagonal divisions of a space can be determined. The link section gives an example of the minimum and maximum number of pentagonal divisions of a space with a set of the four smallest pentagonal polyiamonds.",
        "An example of tiling different spaces with a set of 46 different polyiamond tiles is given in the link section below. The idea here is to tile shapes that have a variety of different sides with two tile sets - one that has very few sides (pentagonal) and the other the maximum number of sides (unitary)."
