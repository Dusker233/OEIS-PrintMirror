        "Base conversion yields a string of digits which by convention has any leading zeros suppressed. However, a conversion which yields a low zero (e.g., 96_10 = 240_6) will see that zero preserved when the string of digits is reversed (e.g., into \"042\"), so it can never match any base-converted strings before reversal. It's therefore not possible to have a solution involving a base which exhibits a low zero for any input x. A consequence of this is that any solution will require both base-converted strings to be of the same length; considering that any solution for a sufficiently-high x will involve only bases 8 and 9 (these having the slowest rate of change with respect to x), we can deduce that the upper limit for valid solutions occurs at the point beyond which length(x base 8) - length(x base 9) is permanently greater than unity, and this can be shown to occur at 8^18, or approximately 1.80*10^16.",
