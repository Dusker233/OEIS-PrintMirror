        "The fourth value was computed by Teofil Camarasu, taking 6 days of computer time performing exact algebraic computations (see link to Mathematics Stack Exchange).",
        "Note that circles are formed only by specifying an already existing segment as radius (so we have collapsible compasses only)."
