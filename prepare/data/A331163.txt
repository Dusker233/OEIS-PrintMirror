        "In the first 10 million terms the most frequently seen digit difference is 1, which leads other digit difference counts for 2589052 terms. The least seen is 9, which only holds the lead for 990 terms and does not become the most frequently seen digit difference until a(23521), after a run of 1228 consecutive terms of 9090. The longest series of unchanging terms begins at a(7727945) = 7040480 which begins a run of 94553 consecutive terms of 7040480."
