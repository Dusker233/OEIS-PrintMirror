    "comment": [
        "The other two variables in the equation result from the division of a prime p by its index i, giving quotient q and remainder r. All four of p, i, q, r are required to be prime.",
        "For all remaining terms, q (which has become greater than 2) will be an odd prime, and q increases exponentially slowly. And when q is odd, exactly one of i and r will be odd. Consequently, a new term will only occur when r = 2 and both q and i are prime.",
