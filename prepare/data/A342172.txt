        "Let S be the prime signature that occurs most frequently among the numbers in the interval I_n = [2^(n-1), 2^n - 1]; then a(n) is the smallest number in I_n whose prime signature is S.",
        "For each n in 1..34, there is only one prime signature in I_n that occurs with the maximum frequency.",
        "Conjecture: for all n >= 1, there is only one prime signature in I_n that occurs with the maximum frequency.",
        "For each n in 1..34, the most common prime signature in I_n is squarefree: 1 for n=1, p for n=2,3,5; p*q for n=4,6..19; p*q*r for 20..34. From limited sampling of portions of the interval I_n for a number of values of n > 34, it appears that p*q*r continues to be the most common prime signature among n-bit numbers for values of n up to roughly 60; for values larger than about 60, p*q*r*s becomes more common than p*q*r.",

        "For n=3, the integers in I_3 = [4, 7] are 4=2^2, 5 (prime), 6=2*3, and 7 (prime), so their prime signatures are p^2, p, p*q, and p, respectively, where p and q are distinct primes; the prime signature that occurs most frequently is p, which is occurs at 5 and 7, so a(3)=5.",
        "For n=4, I_4 = [8, 15]; the integers are 8=2^3, 9=3^2, 10=2*5, 11 (prime), 12=2^2*3, 13 (prime), 14=2*7, and 15=3*5, so the prime signatures are p^3, p^2, p*q, p, p^2*q, p, p*q, and p*q, of which p*q occurs most frequently (at 10, 14, and 15), so a(4)=10.",
        "For n=20, of the 524288 integers in the interval [524288, 1048575], 109245 (about 21%) have the prime signature p*q*r; this is the most common prime signature in the interval, and the smallest number having that prime signature in the interval is 524291 = 29*101*179, so a(20)=524291."
