        "The first positive integer not in b() is 3. To check if 3 is a(1) we note that the smallest element of b() larger than 3 is b(3)=7, hence k=2. There is only one set of coefficients {c(1),c(2)} that allows 3 to be obtained from Sum_{i=1..k} b(i)c(i). These are c(1)=2 and c(2)=1. So 3 is in fact a(1).",
        "The next integer not in b() is 4. To see if it is a(2) we note that k is still 2 in this case. Now there are two possible sets of coefficients that allow the representation of 4: {0,2} and {2,1}, so 4 is not a term."
