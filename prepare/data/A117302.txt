        "We denote by U[7,n,m] the number of cases that the first player gets killed in a Russian roulette game when 7 players use a gun with n chambers and m bullets. They never rotate the cylinder after the game starts. The chambers can be represented by the list {1,2,...,n}. We are going to calculate (0), (1), ..., (t) separately. (0) The first player gets killed when one bullet is in the first chamber and the remaining (m-1) bullets are in {2,3,...,n}. We have binomial(n-1,m-1) cases for this. (1) The first gets killed when one bullet is in the 8th chamber and the rest of the bullets are in {9,..,n}. We have binomial(n-8,m-1) cases for this. We continue to calculate and the last is (t), where t = floor((n-m)/7). (t) The first gets killed when one bullet is in (7t+1)-st chamber and the remaining bullets are in {7t+2,...,n}. We have binomial(n-7t-1,m-1) cases for this. Therefore U[7,n,m] = Sum_{z=0..t} binomial(n-7z-1,m-1), where t = floor((n-m)/7). Let A[7,n] be the number of cases in which the first player gets killed when 7 players use a gun with n chambers and the number of bullets can be from 1 to n. Then A[7,n] = Sum_{m=1..n} U[7,n,m]."
