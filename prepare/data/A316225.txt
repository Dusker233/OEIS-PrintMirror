        "Harborth proved that this sequence is infinite. He showed that the terms are numbers n such that n|sigma(n)*2^(d(n) - 1), where d(n) is the number of divisors of n (A000005) and sigma(n) is their sum (A000203), and that the even terms, numbers of the form r*2^m where r is odd and m > 0, are those with m = ord_2(r/gcd(r, sigma(r)))*i with i = 1, 2, ... (ord_2(k) is the multiplicative order of 2 mod k, A002326). Thus this sequence includes all the powers of 2, all the numbers of the form n = 2^m*(2^(m + 1) - 1) which include the even perfect numbers.",
        "Pollack and Pomerance call these numbers \"H-perfect numbers\". They prove that k is H-perfect if and only if denominator(sigma(k)/k) is a power of 2. - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 02 2020"
