    "comment": [
        "An abelian square is a word of the form x x' where x' is a permutation of x, like the English word \"reappear\". The order of an abelian square x x' is the length of x.",
        "The tribonacci word has abelian squares of all orders. If we consider two abelian squares x x' and y y' to be the same if y is a permutation of x, then some orders have only 1 abelian square (up to this equivalence), while others have 2, and these are the only possibilities. There is a 463-state automaton that recognizes the tribonacci representation of those terms k in this sequence. All this can be proved with the Walnut theorem prover."
