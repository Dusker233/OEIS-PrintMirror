    "comment": [
        "In the long term, the prime sums' residues modulo 10^n are uniformly distributed, so one would expect the n-th term to be about the same size as the n-th prime."

    "example": [
        "2+3+5 = 10, so 5 is the 1st term.",
        "2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23 = 100, so 23 is the 2nd term."
