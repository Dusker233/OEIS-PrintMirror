        "If p = 2^(1+t) + (1+2*t)*k - 1 is a prime, for some t > 0 and k even, then x = 2^t*p is in the sequence where k is the value by which the sum of aliquot parts is increased.",
        "In this sequence k = 10; for t = 22 we get 35186255331328, which is a term greater than 621056, but this does not exclude the existence of other intermediate terms following a different solution pattern. (End)",
        "With the same searching range, no value has been found for the similar sequence with aliquot parts decreased by 10. For n > 10^12, solutions of the kind x = 2^t*p can be found for t = 20, 33, 57, 76, 134, 422, 496, ...: e.g. 2^20*2096741 = 2198592290816.",
        "Terms using odd values of k seem very hard to find. Up to n = 10^12, only three such terms are known: 2, 98, and 8450, for k = 1, 5, and -7, respectively."
