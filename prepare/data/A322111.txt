        "The multiset density of a multiset partition is the sum of the numbers of distinct vertices in each part minus the number of parts minus the number of vertices.",
        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}. A multiset partition is self-dual if it is isomorphic to its dual. For example, {{1,1},{1,2,2},{2,3,3}} is self-dual, as it is isomorphic to its dual {{1,1,2},{2,2,3},{3,3}}.",
        "The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices."
