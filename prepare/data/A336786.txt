        "For D=31, the least x for which x^2-Dy^2=2 has a solution is 39. The next prime, D, for which x^2-Dy^2=2 has a solution is 47, but the smallest x in this case is 7, which is less than 39. The next prime, D, after 47 for which x^2-Dy^2=2 has a solution is 71 and the least x for which it has a solution is x=59, which is larger than 39, so it is a new record value. 71 is a term of this sequence and 59 is a term of A336787. 47 is not a term here because the least x for which x^2-47y^2=2 has a solution is not a record value."
