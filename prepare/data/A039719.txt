        "A simplicial complex is a space with a triangulation. Formally, a simplicial complex K in R^n is a collection of simplices of in R^n such that: (1) Every face of a simplex of K is in K, and (2) The intersection of any two simplices of K is a face of each of them (Munkres 1993, p. 7). - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Feb 03 2011"
