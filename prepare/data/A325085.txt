        "Brink showed that prime numbers congruent to 9, 25 or 57 modulo 112 are representable by exactly one of the quadratic forms x^2 + 14*y^2 or x^2 + 448*y^2. This sequence corresponds to those representable by the first form, and A325086 corresponds to those representable by the second form."
