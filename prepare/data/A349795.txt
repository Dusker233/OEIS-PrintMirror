        "Also the number of weakly alternating non-strict integer partitions of n, where we define a sequence to be weakly alternating if it is alternately weakly increasing and weakly decreasing, starting with either. This sequence looks at the somewhat degenerate case where no strict increases are allowed. Equivalently, these are partitions that are weakly alternating but not strongly alternating."
