        "Alternatively, numbers expressible in more than one way as i^2 - ij + j^2, where 1 <= i <= j or 1 <= i < j. The following argument shows that the conditions i <= j or i < j are here equivalent. Note first that i^2 - ij + j^2 = (j - i)^2 - (j - i)*j + j^2, so the only non-duplicated values i^2 - ij + j^2 with 1 <= i < j are when j = 2i, whence i^2 - ij + j^2 = 3i^2. On the other hand, the values with i = j are j^2. There are no integer solutions to 3i^2 = j^2 with i >= 1. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 03 2006",

        "1729 is also the least term that can be written in 4 distinct ways in the given form. Sequence A024614 does not include the restriction x != y, it is the disjoint union of this sequence and A033428 (i.e., 3*x^2) (without 0). - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 05 2018"
