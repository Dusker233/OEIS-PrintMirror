        "The initial terms correspond to intervals of length <= 2 with only 0 or 1 \"holes\" to fill: In the first case we have the same recursion rule as for the Fibonacci sequence, and when there's one hole (between 3 and 5) the next Fibonacci number b(k+1) = b(k) + b(m) = 3 + 5 = 8 gets filled in there, and the next border is m = b(k) + b(k-1) = 5 + 8 = 13.
