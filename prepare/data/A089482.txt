        "a(6) from _Gordon F. Royle_.",
        "The following is _Max Alekseyev_'s proof of the formula: Suppose that we have a (0,1)-matrix M with permanent equal to 1. Then in M there is a unique set of n elements, each equal to 1, whose product makes the permanent equal 1. Permute the columns of M so that these n elements become arranged along the main diagonal, denote the resulting matrix by M'. It is clear that each M' correspond to n! different matrices M (here the factor n! comes).",
        "Let M'' be the same as M' except for zeros on the main diagonal. Then the permanent of M'' is zero. Viewing M'' as an adjacency matrix of a directed graph G, we notice that G cannot have a cycle. Indeed, if there is a cycle x_1 -> x_2 -> ... -> x_k -> x_1, then the set of elements (x_1,x_2), (x_2,x_3), ..., (x_k,x_1) together (y_1,y_1), ..., (y_{n-k},y_{n-k}), where { y_1,...,y_{n-k} } is the complement of { x_1, ..., x_k } in the set { 1, 2, ..., n }, form a set of elements of the matrix M' whose product is 1, making the permanent of M' greater than 1.",
        "This works in the reverse direction as well, resulting in the statement: The permanent of M' is 1 if and only if M'' represents the adjacency matrix of some DAG. Therefore there exist A003024(n) distinct matrices M'. - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Oct 27 2009"
