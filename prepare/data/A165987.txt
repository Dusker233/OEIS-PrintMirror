    "name": "As mentioned in the short description (cf. A165806 & A165808) polynomials have the property: f(x + k*f(x) is congruent to 0 mod(f(x)). This is true even if the variable is a square matrix. For this sequence let X be a 2x2 matrix (X belongs to Z): col1:-13, 31;col2: 17, 97. Let the polynomial be X^3 -5X + 67. The present sequence is a sequence of traces of the matrices resulting from the division of f(X + k*f(X))/f(X). Here k belongs to N.",

        "Although no program in PARI is used, the PARI calculator is used to compute the /Q quotient (a 2 X 2 matrix); the trace is the sum of the elements of the principal diagonal."
