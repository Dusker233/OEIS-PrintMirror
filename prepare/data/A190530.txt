        "If for some prime p such that 2^p-1 is also prime one has n = 2^(p+1) - 3 an odd perfect number, (that is in particular not squarefree), then the even perfect number m = 2^(p-1)(2^p-1) and the odd perfect number n, are the second pair of perfect numbers (m,n) with m > n such that m/(n+1) is a power of 2. Indeed we have in this case: m/(n+1)=2^(p-2). The only other known pair of such numbers is (m,n) = (28,6), so that m/(n+1) = 28/7 = 2^2.",
