        "Related to Zarankiewicz's problem k_3(n) (cf. A001198 and other crossrefs), which asks the converse: how many 1's must be in an n X n {0,1}-matrix in order to guarantee the existence of an all-ones 3 X 3 submatrix. This complementarity leads to the given formula which was used to compute the given values."

        "For n = 4, having at most 2 nonzero entries in the n X n matrix guarantees that there is a 3 X 3 zero submatrix (delete, e.g., the row which has the first nonzero entry, then the column with the remaining nonzero entry, if any), but if one allows 3 nonzero entries and they are placed on the diagonal, then there is no 3 X 3 zero submatrix. Hence, a(4) = 2."
