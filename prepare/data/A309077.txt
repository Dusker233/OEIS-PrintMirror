        "A factorization of a binary string x is an expression of the form prod_i w_i^{e_i}, where each w_i is a word and e_i is an integer exponent specifying how many times the word is repeated.  For example 0101000 = (01)^2 0^3.  A minimal factorization is one that minimizes the weight of the factorization, which is defined to be sum of the lengths of the w_i.   a(n) then measures the maximum weight over all length-n binary strings.",
        "Since there are arbitrarily long binary words having no repetitions larger than squares (Thue 1906), we see that a(n) >= n/2.  By considering a(14) = 9, and splitting a word into blocks of size 14 and one left over, we see that a(n) <= 0.644 n for sufficiently large n.",
