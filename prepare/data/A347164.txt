        "If k is a term of the sequence then some nonzero digit must occur more than once in the decimal representation of 2^k because 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45, and 2^k is not divisible by 9. Thus 2^k>10^10 and therefore k>33 for any term k.",
        "A positive integer k is a term of the sequence iff a decimal representation of the remainder of 2^k modulo 10^10 (possibly containing a leading zero) is a permutation of the string \"0123456789\".",
        "Let d = 7812500 = 4*5^9 = phi(5^10) where phi is Euler's totient function. The remainders of the powers of 2 modulo 10^10 form an eventually periodic sequence with period d: if k >= 10 then 2^(k+d) - 2^k is divisible by 10^10 since 2^(k+d) - 2^k = 2^k*(2^d-1) and 10^10 = 2^10*5^10. Hence if k >= 10 then k + d is a term iff k is a term.",
        "Actually the above equivalence holds for all positive integers k because neither k nor k + d is a term of the sequence for k < 10 (the decimal representations of the numbers 2^(k + d) with k = 1, 2, ..., 9 end, respectively, with the following strings: 3574218752, 7148437504, 4296875008, 8593750016, 7187500032, 4375000064, 8750000128, 7500000256, 5000000512).",
