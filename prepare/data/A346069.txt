    "comment": [
        "On a square grid place the numbers 1 to n in any order or position. If any two numbers are orthogonally adjacent, those two numbers are multiplied, and the sum over all these pair products is then found. The sequence gives the maximum possible value of this sum when placing numbers from 1 up to n.",
        "Clearly, to maximize the sum, all numbers should have one or more adjacent neighbors, and in general the larger numbers should be placed so that they are adjacent to other large numbers so that their products contribute the most to the final sum. Unlike the addition case of A348090 the numbers in general cannot be switched, even if they have the same number of orthogonal neighbors, since the values of a number's neighbors does effect the overall contribution that each pair product has to the final sum."

The combinations with the largest pair products are 1-3-2 and 2-3-1, the product sum being (1*3)+(3*2) = 9. This is the largest sum as 3 is placed so that it is in two pairs and thus its products contributes twice to the sum.",
