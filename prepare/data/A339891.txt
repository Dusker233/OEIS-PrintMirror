        "The difference between \"fundamentally different graceful labelings\" of a graph and \"graceful labelings\" of a graph is that the latter is the former multiplied by twice the number of automorphisms. (The extra factor of 2 comes from complementation.)",
        "When n>1, the graph K_1,1,n has 2n! automorphisms."
