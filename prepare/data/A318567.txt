        "Also the number of combinatory separations of normal multisets of weight n with constant parts. A multiset is normal if it spans an initial interval of positive integers. The type of a multiset is the unique normal multiset that has the same sequence of multiplicities when its entries are taken in increasing order. For example the type of 335556 is 112223. A pair h<={g_1,...,g_k} is a combinatory separation iff there exists a multiset partition of h whose multiset of block-types is {g_1,...,g_k}."
