        "Mallows (1979) comments that I. J. Good did not consider all kinds of independence between n random variables in deriving his formula for the e.g.f. of a(n). Unfortunately, the paper by Good (1975), where the proof of the e.g.f. was published, is not easily accessible.",
        "We give a sketch of a proof of the formula below (using only the ideas of independence that I. J. Good considered). Given r.v.'s X_1, X_2, ..., X_n, we choose s of them on which to condition (where s = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2). By \"condition\", we mean that we condition on every possible s-tuple of values of those chosen variables. This can be done in C(n, s) ways.",
        "Note that we can only condition on up to n-2 variables, because we need at least two variables to define any kind of independence: conditional (s >= 1) or unconditional (s = 0). Thus, 2 <= n-s <= n.",
        "From the remaining n-s variables, we choose t of them (where 2 <= t <= n-s) on which we will define (or test) independence. [According to Mallows (1979), this is the only kind of independence Good (1975) considers.]  There are C(n-s, t) ways to choose the t variables on which to define (or test) independence.",
        "Now, there are Bell(t) - 1 = A058692(t) ways to partition the set of t chosen variables into one or more subsets, say {S_1, ..., S_r} (the order of the subsets is not important). Here |S_i| >= 1 and (S_1 union S_2 union ... union S_r) equals the t chosen variables. Thus, there are Bell(t) - 1 ways to factor the joint p.d.f. of the chosen t variables into the product of the joint marginal p.d.f.'s of the variables in S_i (i = 1, ..., r). [By \"joint marginal p.d.f.\" for group S_i we mean the joint p.d.f of all the variables in group S_i.] Each such factorization defines a different kind of independence of the chosen variables (conditional on the original chosen s variables).",
        "Thus, in the sense of Good (1975, 1979), there are a(n) = Sum_{s = 0..n-2} Sum_{t = 2..n-s} C(n, s) * C(n-s, t) * (Bell(t) - 1) kinds of independence among the variables.",
        "Letting k = n-s, we get a(n) = Sum_{k = 2..n} Sum_{t = 2..k} C(n, n-k) * C(k, t) * (Bell(t) - 1) = Sum_{k = 2..n} Sum_{t = 2..k} C(n, k) * C(k, t) * (Bell(t) - 1).",
        "The second formula for a(n) follows from the fact that Sum_{m = 2..k} binomial(k,m) * (Bell(m) - 1) = A058681(k) = Bell(k+1) - 2^k.",
        "Counting all kinds of independence, as suggested by Mallows (1979), seems to be a very difficult task. For example, for n = 3, he finds a(3) = 17 kinds of independence rather than 10.",
