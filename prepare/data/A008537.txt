        "This sequence contains 42 nonzero terms below 10^9, plus the initial a(1) = 0.",
        "Since \"hundred\", \"thousand\", \"million\" etc. are forbidden, the only way to extend the sequence would be to use long scale with \"milliard\" for 10^9: then the next term would be a(44) = 2*10^9 = \"two milliards\", a(45) = 2*10^9 + 2, and so on.",
        "The 2019 \"April Fools contest\" on codeforces.com referred to these numbers as \"Kanban numbers\", i.e., numbers which ban the letters 'k', 'a' and 'n'. But no 'k' ever appears, and unless we consider \"milliard\", 'a' only appears (in \"thousand\" and later \"quadrillion\") in conjunction with 'n', which therefore is the only relevant. So \"n-ban (or maybe: anban) numbers\" would be more a adequate name. (End)"
