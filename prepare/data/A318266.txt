Note that some \"legal\" positions are not reachable in a game: e.g., white Ka1 vs. black Kc3 + Qc2 + Qb3 (black to move) is counted in a(4), although it is impossible to reach such a position.",

    "example": [
        "There are 3612 ways to place 2 kings on a chessbard so that they are not in check, which would not be a legal position: this decomposes as 3612 = 4*(64-4) [when white king is in a corner] + 6*4*(64-6) [when white king is on a side] + (64-28)*(64-9) [when white king is not touching any side of the board]. Killing \"isomorphic\" positions due to symmetries reduces this number to 462 remaining different positions. Symmetries roughly lead to a division by 8, but not exactly, because they have some fixed points (e.g., the position with kings on A1 and H8 is a fixed point for the diagonal symmetry). Therefore a(2)=462."
