        "A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. The multiset of multisets with MM-number n is formed by taking the multiset of prime indices of each part of the multiset of prime indices of n. For example, the prime indices of 78 are {1,2,6}, so the multiset of multisets with MM-number 78 is {{},{1},{1,2}}."
