        "This is the complement in A000040 of the finite list of primes that divide one or more 10-digit pandigital numbers. That finite list has been obtained by computer; it contains 1102173 primes, with the first prime that is not in the list being prime(10545) = 111119 and the last that is in the list being prime(55537259) = 1097393447."

        "a(1) = 111119 because 111119 is prime and does not divide any of the 10-digit pandigital numbers 1023456789, 1023456798, ..., 9876543210, and all smaller primes do divide at least one of them."
