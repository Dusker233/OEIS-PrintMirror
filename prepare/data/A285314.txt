        "For a generalized Lucas sequence {U(n)} = {(a^n - b^n)/(a - b)}, where a + b and ab are nonzero coprime integers and (a/b) is not a root of unity, a prime factor of the n-th term of some Lucas sequence U(n) is called primitive if it does not divide U(r) for any r < n.",
        "Let P = a + b > 0, Q = ab and D = P^2 - 4Q = (a - b)^2. In the case a, b are real (equivalently, D > 0), Carmichael shows that, if n <> 1, 2, 6, then U(n) has at least one primitive prime factor not dividing D except U(3) ((P, Q, D) = (1, -2, 9), (1, -1, 5)), U(5) ((P, Q, D) = (1, -1, 5)) and U(12) ((P, Q, D) = (1, -1, 5)).",

        "Let {U(n)} be a generalized Lucas sequence. If p is a prime U(p) has no primitive prime factor, then U(p) = +-1. In contrast, if k is a composite number such that U(k) has no primitive prime factor, then U(k) cannot be +-1. As a result, the possible solutions to U(k) = +-1 for some Lucas sequence are k = 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13.",
        "From U(1) = 1, U(2) = P, U(3) = P^2 - Q, U(4) = P*(P^2 - 2*Q), U(6) = P*(P^2 - Q)*(P^2 - 3*Q) we can see that for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, there are infinitely many Lucas sequences such that U(k) has no primitive prime factor. Also, for p = 2, 3, there are infinitely many Lucas sequences such that any prime factor of U(p) divides D.",
        "This sequence lists also numbers k such that E(p) = k has no solution over the primes for some Lucas sequence {U(n)}, where E(p) is the entry point of {U(n)} modulo p, that is, the smallest m > 0 such that p divides U(m). (End)"
