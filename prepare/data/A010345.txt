        "Also called Perfect Digital Invariant (PDI). When a(n) ends in 0, then a(n+1) = a(n) + 1 is also in the sequence, but in this base this only happens once. Zero would also satisfy the definition (n = Sum_{i=1..k} d[i]^k where d[1..k] are the base-5 digits of n), like the other single-digit terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 18 2019",
        "The property of being an Armstrong number is an arithmetic property (like the number of divisors function) and is usually restricted to positive numbers. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 29 2019"
