        "On the semi-infinite square grid we start with no toothpicks.",
        "At stage 1 we place a single toothpick of length 1 which has one of its endpoints on the straight line.",
        "New generations of toothpicks are added according to these rules: each exposed endpoint of toothpicks of the old generation must be touched by the 3 endpoints of three toothpicks of the new generation. Effectively these three toothpicks look like a T-toothpick (see A160172). The straight line that delimits the square grid acts like an impenetrable \"absorbing\" boundary: toothpicks may touch this line with at most one of their endpoints; these endpoints are not \"exposed.\"",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks in the toothpick structure after n-th stage. The first differences (A183149) give the number of toothpicks added at n-th stage."
