        "Bugeaud proves that the largest prime factor in a(n) increases without bound; in particular, for any e > 0 and all large n, the largest prime factor in a(n) is (1-e) * log log a(n) * log log log a(n) / log log log log a(n). So the largest prime factor in a(n) is more than k log n log log n/log log log n for any k < 1/3 and large enough n.",
        "It appears that a(1293) = 4096 is the largest power of 2 in the sequence, a(1349) = 4608 is the largest 3-smooth number in this sequence, a(1598) = 6075 is the largest 5-smooth number in this sequence, a(5746) = 500094 is the largest 7- and 11-smooth number in this sequence, a(9158) = 5010005 is the largest 13-smooth member in this sequence, etc."
