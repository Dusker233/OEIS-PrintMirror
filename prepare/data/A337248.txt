        "[2] |sec(x)| - |tan(x)| approaches 0, and |sec(x)| and |tan(x)| approach infinity, as x approaches (0.5 + n)*Pi where n is any integer.",

        "Therefore, for any integer k > 2685575996367 where sec(k) > k, it must be that sec(k) - |tan(k)| < 8.437*10^-14. In order for sec(k) > k but |tan(k)| < k, it must be that k + 8.437*10^-14 > sec(k) > k, a very small interval that only gets smaller as k increases.",
        "It is thus extremely likely, but not yet explicitly proven, that a(8) = 65398140378926, a(9) = 214112296674652, and a(10) = 12055686754159438. Assuming it exists, the smallest k for which sec(k) > k but |tan(k)| < k is probably very large, and it is unknown whether it is currently computable. (End)"
