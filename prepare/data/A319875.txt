    "comment": [
        "More formally, the board considered in the computation of a(n) is represented by N^pi(n), where N denotes the set of nonnegative integers and pi the prime-counting function (see A000720). For k an integer between 1 and n, stone k belongs to location (v_2(k), v_3(k), ..., v_{prime(pi(n))}(k)), where the v_p, for p = 2, 3, ..., prime(pi(n)) are the first pi(n) p-adic valuations (also called orders) of k. A liberty of a group of stones is an unoccupied location adjacent to a location occupied by a stone of the group. By definition, a(n) is the number of liberties of the group of stones k = 1 to n. Notice that the board only has one corner at (0, 0, ..., 0)."

The removal of the liberty at (0,0,1) by stone number 5 is compensated by the creation of a new one at (0,0,2). Stone 5 creates no other liberties, as (1,0,1) and (0,1,1) were already taken into account earlier. The balance is the addition of 4 liberties, so a(5) = a(4) + 4 = 8.",
