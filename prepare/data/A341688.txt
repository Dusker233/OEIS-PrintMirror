        "The ellipse, with width twice its height, has points at its x-axis extrema and n-1 points both above and below the x-axis, 2n points in total. These are placed on the ellipse's perimeter by dividing it from the origin into 2n sectors of equal angle.",
        "The terms are from numeric computation - no formula for a(n) is currently known."
