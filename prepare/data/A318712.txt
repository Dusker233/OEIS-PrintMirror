        "If n cards are cut into m packets of s cards each, the r-th card of the deck can be identified with the pair (p,q), where p=(r-1)%s+1 ('%' is the Euclidean division) is the number of the packet and q=((r-1) mod s)+1 is the position in the packet, e.g. n=4, m=2, s=2: 1->(1,1), 2->(1,2), 3->(2,1), 4->(2,2).",
        "The shuffle is performed by taking the card with the lowest q of each packet in sequence and stack them on top of one another. It is a generalization of the riffle shuffle with two cards (cf. A217948) and it can be described as a permutation where (p,q) becomes (((q-1)*m+p-1)%s+1,(((q-1)*m+p-1) mod s)+1). For example, n=8, m=4, s=2, (1,1)->(1,1), (2,1)->(1,2), (3,1)->(2,1), (4,1)->(2,2), (1,2)->(3,1), (2,2)->(3,2), (3,2)->(4,1), (4,2)->(4,2); this permutation can be described using the index r as (3,2,5)(4,6,7).",
        "The numbers in the sequence are the values of n for which the permutation consists of only one orbit with n-2 passages (e.g. n=6, m=3, s=2 is (3,2,4,5)).",
        "Sequence A217948 is a subsequence of this one as it only takes into consideration the m=2 case.",
        "If the formula is true then Tiago Januario's conjecture on A217948 would be solved (see formula)."
