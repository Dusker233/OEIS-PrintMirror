    "name": "Number of grains of sand required to be added to one cell at the origin in an initially empty and infinite 3D cubic grid for the 3D sandpile model such that the distance from the origin of the furthest nonempty cell along the axes is n.",
    "comment": [
        "The 3D sandpile model follows the same rules as the 2D model except that cells topple and transfer one grain of sand to their six nearest neighbors when the cell contains 6 or more grains. Cells containing 0 to 5 grains are stable."
