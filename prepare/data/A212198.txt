        "Conjectured to be the number of permutations of length n avoiding the partially ordered pattern (POP) {1>5, 2>5, 5>3, 5>4} of length 5. That is, conjectured to be the number of length n permutations having no subsequences of length 5 in which the fifth element is larger than the elements in positions 3 and 4, but smaller than the elements in positions 1 and 2. - _Sergey Kitaev_, Dec 13 2020"
