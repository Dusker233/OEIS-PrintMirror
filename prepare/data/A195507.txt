        "Conjecture: The sequence (a(n): n >= 1) satisfies the following recurrence. Write a(n)/n in lowest terms as num/d. Then a(n+1) = d*a(n) - (d-1)*n + 1. Illustration: a(4) = 10 and a(4)/4 = 5/2 in lowest terms. Then a(5) = 2*10 - 1*4 + 1 = 17.  (This has been verified up to a(23) = 232792583.)",
        "This follows from the formula below. The value d is 1 unless n is a  prime power p^k, in which case it is p. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Sep 20 2011"
