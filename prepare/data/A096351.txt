        "One example of such an operation is given in the original sequence definition: the meaningfully different single-elimination tournaments on n teams, where the binary operation is the pairwise game.",
        "Another example is floating-point addition: a(n) is the number of computationally equivalent pairwise summations on n floating-point numbers, using the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic in very common use on digital systems in 2020. IEEE 754 guarantees pairwise commutativity of addition, but not associativity, and in fact can give different results for summations with the same summands having different groupings. (End)"
