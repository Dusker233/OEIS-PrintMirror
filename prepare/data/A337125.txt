        "The definition can also be formulated as: a(n) is the length of the longest sequence of distinct numbers between 1 and n such that if k immediately follows m, then either k divides m or m divides k. - _Peter Luschny_, Dec 28 2020",
        "Can be formulated as an optimal subtour problem by introducing a depot node 0 that is adjacent to all other nodes. An integer linear programming formulation is as follows. For {i,j} in E, let binary decision variable x_{i,j} indicate whether edge {i,j} is traversed, and for i in N let binary decision variable y_i indicate whether node i is visited. The objective is to maximize Sum_{i in N \\ {0}} y_i. The constraints are Sum_{{i,j} in E: k in {i,j}} x_{i,j} = 2 y_k for all k in N, y_0 = 1, as well as (dynamically generated) generalized subtour elimination constraints Sum_{i in S, j in S: {i,j} in E} x_{i,j} <= Sum_{i in S \\ {k}} y_i for all S subset N \\ {0} and k in S. - _Rob Pratt_, Dec 28 2020"
