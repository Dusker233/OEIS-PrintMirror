        "The most natural mathematical generalization of the well-known \"Nine Dots Problem\" by Sam Loyd (published in Cyclopedia of puzzles, p. 301, in 1914) is an NP-hard challenge with no AABB, no constraint about visiting any vertex more than once or self-crossing lines, no restriction on the turning angles available.",
