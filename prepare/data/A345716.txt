        "This sequence has been verified by brute force up to n = 27. It matches the covering numbers C(n+1, 3,2), A011975, for the first 14 terms, and it is conjectured that it matches for all even n. Link to the brute force program below. Computational runtime and increased complexity for minimum arrangements for bigger n account for the low number of terms.
