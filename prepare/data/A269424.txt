        "Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions suggests that average gaps between primes of the form 8k + 1 below x are about phi(8)*log(x). This sequence shows that the record gap ending at p grows almost as fast as phi(8)*log^2(p). Here phi(n) is A000010, Euler's totient function; phi(8)=4.",
