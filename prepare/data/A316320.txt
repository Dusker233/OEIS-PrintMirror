        "Let E denote the lattice of Eisenstein integers u + v*w in the plane, with each point joined to its six neighbors. Here u and v are ordinary integers and w = (-1+sqrt(-3))/2 is a complex cube root of unity. Let theta = w - w^2 = sqrt(-3). Then theta*E is a sublattice of E of index 3 (Conway-Sloane, Fig. 7.2). The tiling considered in this sequence is obtained by replacing each node in theta*E by a small hexagon."
