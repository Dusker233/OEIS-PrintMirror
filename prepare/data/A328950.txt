        "Given a deck of cards consisting of one 1, two 2's, three 3's, ..., n n's, what's the best average number of yes-or-no questions needed to ask to determine a randomly drawn card?  The answer is the above sequence divided by the number of cards (A000217).",
        "The problem can be solved using Huffman codes.",
        "This problem was popularized in Martin Gardner's Scientific American \"Mathematical Games\" column, and was included in his book \"My Best Mathematical and Logic Puzzles\"."
