        "The first 20 terms of this sequence are also the first 20 terms of A144695: m such that sigma(m)/tau(m) is a square. Indeed, if sigma(m)/tau(m) is a square then sigma(m)*tau(m) is also a square, but the converse is false. These counterexamples are in A327831; the first one is a(21) = 232.",
        "The primes p of the form 2*k^2 - 1: 7, 17, 31, 71, ... (A066436) form a subsequence because sigma(p) * tau(p) = (2*k)^2.",
        "Another subsequence consists of the terms m such that sigma(m) and tau(m) are both squares; this occurs when m is the product of two distinct primes p*q, p < q where sigma(m) = (p+1)*(q+1) is a square and tau(m) = 4. The first few terms are 22, 94, 115, 119, 214, ... They are in A256152."
