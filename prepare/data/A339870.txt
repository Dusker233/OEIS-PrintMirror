        "Equally, squarefree composite numbers k of the form 4u+1 for which A336466(k) divides k-1. This follows because on squarefree n, A336466(n) = A053575(n).",
        "No common terms with A016105, because 4xy + 2(x+y) + 1 does not divide 4xy + 3(x+y) + 2 for any distinct x, y >= 0 (where 4x+3 and 4y+3 are the two prime factors of Blum integers).",
        "This can also seen by another way: If this sequence contained any Blum integers, then, because A016105 is a subsequence of A339817, we would have found a composite number n satisfying Lehmer's totient problem y * phi(n) = n-1, for some integer y > 1. But Lehmer proved that such solutions should have at least 7 distinct prime factors, while Blum integers have only two.",
        "Moreover, it seems that none of the terms of A167181 may occur here, and a few of A137409 (i.e., of A125667). See A339875 for those terms.",
