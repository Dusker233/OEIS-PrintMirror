        "Start with an infinite square grid. Each cell has eight neighbors. Place n 1's anywhere. Now place the numbers 2, 3, ..., m in order, subject to the rule that when you place k, the sum of its neighbors must equal k. Then a(n) is the maximum m that can be achieved.",
        "a(1) - a(4) were found by _Thomas Ladouceur_ and _Jeremy Rebenstock_ by considering all the possibilities (by computer - see link to Python program).",
        "Note that a(n) always exists, by definition. But it is possible that it is infinity. One consequence of the following argument is that a(n) < oo. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 08 2020",
        "From _Robert Gerbicz_, Oct 08 2020: (Start)",
        "a(n) = O(n*log(n)^2). Proof:",
        "Assume k > 1. Since the square containing k is the sum of its neighbors, one neighbor will be at most k/2. Continuing this (with the smallest term from the sum): if k < 2^(d+1) then one term within distance d from the square containing k will be at most 1, hence exactly one.",
        "But n squares (containing ones) cover at most (2*d+1)^2*n squares within distance d. So for all d > 0, min(2^(d+1)-2, a(n)-1) <= (2*d+1)^2*n.",
        "From this a(n) is finite because 2^d/d^2 is unbounded. Use the inequality for that d where 2^(d+1) < a(n) <= 2^(d+2), then (a(n)-4)/2 <= 2^(d+1)-2 = min(2^(d+1)-2, a(n)-1) <= (2*d+1)^2*n < 4*log_2(a(n))^2*n, and from a(n) < 4 + 8*log_2(a(n))^2*n it is easy to see that a(n) = O(n*log(n)^2). (End)",
        "From _Robert Gerbicz_, Apr 26 2021: (Start)",
        "a(n) < 714*n. Proof:",
        "As above, assume k > 1; since the square containing k is the sum of its neighbors, one neighbor will be at most k/2. Continuing this in at most d=11 steps we get a square not larger than max(1, k/2048).",
        "This means that the n ones and the integers in [2, k/2048] cover all integers from [2,k] within a distance of d=11. A single square covers at most (2*d+1)^2 squares, hence 23^2*(n + k/2048) >= k-1.",
        "From this, k < 714*n, so a(n) is finite and a(n) < 714*n. (More precisely we got a(n) <= (1083392*n + 2048)/1519.) This idea works for any d > 8 steps, but gives the best upper bound for d=11. (End)",
