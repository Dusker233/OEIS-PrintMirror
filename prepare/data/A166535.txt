        "It appears (but has not yet been proved) that the terms of a(n) can be computed recursively as follows. Let {c(i)} be defined for i >= 5 by c(i)=2c(i-1)+1 if i is congruent to 2 mod 4, else c(i)=2c(i-1)-1. I.e., {c(i)}={1,3,5,9,17,35,...} for i=5,6,7,... . Let a(n)=n for n=1,2,...,7. For n>7, choose k so that s(k) < n < s(k+1), where s(k) = Sum_{j=3..k} t(j) with t(j) being the j-th term of the tribonacci sequence A000073 (with initial terms t(0)=0, t(1)=0, t(2)=1). Then a(n) = c(k) + 2a(s(k)) - a(2s(k)+1). This has been verified for n up to 2400.",
