        "The prime factorizations of k = 15 and k+1 = 16 are 3 * 5 and 2^4, respectively, so their prime signatures can be represented as [1,1] and [4], respectively. If any ordered pair of consecutive integers m and m+1 has this same ordered pair of prime signatures, then m+1 = p^4 for some prime p, so m = p^4 - 1 = (p-1)*(p+1)*(p^2+1), which is a multiple of 16 for any odd prime p, so the prime signature of m cannot be [1,1] unless the prime p is even, i.e., p = 2, so m = 2^4 - 1 = 15; there is no m other than k = 15 that yields the same pair of prime signatures, so k = 15 is a term of the sequence.",
