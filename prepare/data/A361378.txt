        "If you take any three consecutive notes in the scales counted by a(n) (with cyclic identification) then the distance between the first and third is either 3 or 4 semitones. a(n) is also the number of subsets of Z/nZ that 1) contain 0; 2) contain no subset of the form {x,x+1,x+2}; 3) have no superset satisfying property 2)."
