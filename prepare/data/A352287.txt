    "comment": [
        "When considering whether an integer k is the order of a finite simple group, the first thing one checks is whether the number of p-Sylow subgroups is forced to be 1 for some p dividing k. This occurs if the only divisor of k which is 1 (mod p) is 1 itself. This sequence consists of the numbers that survive this test."
