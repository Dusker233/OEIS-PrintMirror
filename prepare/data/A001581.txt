    "comment": [
        "The \"Fibonacci nim\" considered here is the one with a pile of n stones from which, at each move, a player removes a Fibonacci number of stones, with the last player to move winning. It should be distinguished from a different game with the same name, in which any number of stones up to twice the previous move can be removed. The nim-values for this game are given in A014588; this sequence gives the indexes at which A014588 is zero. Most of the winning positions of the game appear to be even, but some (for instance 169) are not; A120904 gives the odd winning positions. - _David Eppstein_, Jun 14 2018",
        "With an initial 0, the lexicographically least sequence such that all pairwise differences are in A001690 (complement of the Fibonacci numbers). - _Charlie Neder_, Feb 23 2019"

        "Starting with a heap of size 10, your opponent can move to 9, 8, 7, 5, or 2. If your opponent moves to 8, 5, or 2, you can move directly to 0, and if they move to 9 or 7, you can move to 4, a winning position. Therefore 10 is also winning. - _Charlie Neder_, Feb 23 2019"
