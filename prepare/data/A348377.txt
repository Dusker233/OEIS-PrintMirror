        "A sequence is alternating if it is alternately strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, starting with either. For example, the partition (3,2,2,2,1) has no alternating permutations, even though it does have the anti-run permutations (2,3,2,1,2) and (2,1,2,3,2). Alternating permutations of multisets are a generalization of alternating or up-down permutations of {1..n}."
