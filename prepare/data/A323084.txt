        "4224 is a term because 4224 is a 4-digit number whose digits (4,2,2,4) are the number of prime factors (with multiplicity) in each of the following 4 integers; i.e., 4225 = 5^2*13^2 (four prime factors), 4226 = 2*2113 (two prime factors), 4227 = 3*1409 (two prime factors), and 4228 = 2^2*7*151 (four prime factors), therefore (4,2,2,4) -> 4224."
