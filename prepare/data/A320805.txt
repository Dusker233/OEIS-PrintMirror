        "Also the number of nonnegative integer matrices up to row and column permutations with sum of elements equal to n and no zero rows or columns, in which (1) the positive entries in each row are relatively prime and (2) the column sums are relatively prime.",
        "A multiset is aperiodic if its multiplicities are relatively prime.",
