        "Sum of pyramid weights of all nondecreasing Dyck paths of semilength n. (A pyramid in a Dyck word (path) is a factor of the form U^h D^h, where U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and h is the height of the pyramid. A pyramid in a Dyck word w is maximal if, as a factor in w, it is not immediately preceded by a u and immediately followed by a d. The pyramid weight of a Dyck path (word) is the sum of the heights of its maximal pyramids.) Example: a(4) = 46. Indeed, there are 14 Dyck paths of semilength 4. One of them, namely UUDUDDUD is not nondecreasing because the valleys are at heights 1 and 0. The other 13, with the maximal pyramids shown between parentheses, are: (UD)(UD)(UD)(UD), (UD)(UD)(UUDD), (UD)(UUDD)(UD), (UD)U(UD)(UD)D, (UD)(UUUDDD), (UUDD)(UD)(UD), (UUDD)(UUDD), (UUUDDD)(UD), U(UD)(UD)(UD)D, U(UD)(UUDD)D, U(UUDD)(UD)D, UU(UD)(UD)DD and (UUUUDDDD). The pyramid weights of these paths are 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, and 4, respectively. Their sum is 46. a(n) = Sum_{k = 1..n} k*A121462(n, k). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 31 2006",

Example: a(2) = 4 because the compositions of 2 are 11, 11', 1'1, 1'1', 2, having a total of 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4 1s. Also number of k's in all compositions of n + k (k = 2, 3, ...). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 21 2008",

        "Here, b_k(n) is the number of all (linear) compositions of n with k parts where a part of size m is colored with one of c(m) colors. Thus, Sum_{k = 1..n} k*b_k(n) is the total number of parts in all compositions of n.",
        "If we differentiate the bivariate g.f. function above, i.e., Sum_{n, k >= 1} b_k(n)*x^n*y^k, with respect to y and set y = 1, we get the g.f. of the sequence (Sum_{k = 1..n} k*b_k(n): n >= 1). It is C(x)/(1 - C(x))^2.",
        "When c(m) = m for all m >= 1, we have m-color compositions of n that were first studied by Agarwal (2000). The cyclic version of these m-color compositions were studied by Gibson (2017) and Gibson et al. (2018).",
        "When c(m) = m for each m >= 1, we have C(x) = x/(1 - x)^2, and so C(x)/(1 - C(x))^2 = x * (1 - x)^2/(1 - 3*x + x^2)^2, which is the g.f. of the current sequence.",
