        "The formula a(n) = 2*a(n-2)-1 also fits empirically. With the given initial numbers a(1)=3, a(2)=4, a(3)=5, this new formula implies the old empirical formula. (But it is not established that the old empirical formula is true, so it is not established that the new formula is true either.) Furthermore, if the initial numbers had somehow, for example, been 3,4,6 instead, the new formula no longer implies the old formula.",
        "If the new formula actually is true, it follows that a(n) is the number of distinct integer triangles that can be formed with sides of length a(n-1) and a(n-2), since the greatest length the third side can have is a(n-1)+a(n-2)-1, and the least length would be a(n-1)-a(n-2)+1. (End)",
