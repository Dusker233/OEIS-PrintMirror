        "However, with abs(3/2 - w) > abs(4/3 - w)> abs(7/5 - w), 4/3 is another best approximation which has to be inserted. Generally, after each principal convergent p/q, we must insert the correspondent intermediate convergent 2q/p = (2/1), 4/3, (10/7), 24/17, ..., if it is closer to w than p/q (terms without brackets).",
        "It is a well-known fact that the geometric mean sqrt(a*b) of two factors a and b is closer to the smaller one. As w is the geometric mean of p/q and 2q/p, the second term is inserted if it is smaller than p/q. This applies to every second intermediate convergent because the principal convergents alternately undershoot and overshoot w."
