        "A binary index of n (row n of A048793) is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every finite set of finite nonempty sets has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary digits (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18.",
        "The axiom of choice says that, given any set of nonempty sets Y, it is possible to choose a set containing an element from each. The strict version requires this set to have the same cardinality as Y, meaning no element is chosen more than once."
