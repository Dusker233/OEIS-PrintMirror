        "Start with an n X n square grid. Each cell has up to eight neighbors. Place the numbers 1 and 2 in any two cells of the grid. Then place a number in each remaining cell, in increasing order (not necessarily using consecutive integers), and with the rule that when you place the number k in a cell, the sum of the numbers in its neighboring cells must equal k. The goal is to fill the grid in such a way as to minimize the largest number placed.",
