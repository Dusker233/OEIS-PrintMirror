        "A k-colored graph on n nodes with restricted labels is a labeled k-colored graph (as in A334282) with color set {c1,c2,...,ck} such that the nodes assigned to color c1 are labeled with the integers {1,2,...,n_c1}, the nodes assigned to color c2 are labeled with the next smallest n_c2 integers {n_c1+1,n_c1+2,... n_c1+n_c2}, and generally the nodes assigned to color cj are labeled with the smallest n_cj integers not previously used to label nodes having colors c1,c2,...c(j-1) where ncj is the number of nodes having color j and nc1+nc2+...+nck=n and each ncj>0."
