        "The sequence properly contains A005097. 170 is the first number which is not in A005097. One can prove that A002326(2^(2t-1)) = 4t. Thus if n=2^(2t-1), where, for any m>0, t=2^(m-1) then 2n is a multiple of A002326(n) while 2n+1 is a Fermat number which, as well known, is not always a prime.",
        "The sequence is the union of A005097 and (A001567 - 1)/2. [Conjectured by _Vladimir Shevelev_, proved by _Ray Chandler_, May 26 2008]"
