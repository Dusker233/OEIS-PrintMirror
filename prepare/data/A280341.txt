        "Here the height is defined to be the number of halving and tripling steps required to reach 1.",
        "Interestingly the values in this sequence grow slowly (almost linearly) indicating that the average number of starting values with the same height increases with n.",
        "Question: Is this sequence always increasing?",

        "This sequence a(n) as well as the sequence of maximum heights in each interval appear to increase quadratically with n.  The odd numbers in [2^n, 2^(n+1)) , 5 <= n <= 20, create all distinct heights for the interval except for height n of number 2^n, and except for height n+3 when n is odd. - _Hartmut F. W.
