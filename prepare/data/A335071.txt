        "Can two consecutive numbers have the same abundancy: sigma(m)/m = sigma(m+1)/(m+1)? If yes, then this sequence is finite.",
        "There is no disproof of existence, but this would require both of the consecutive numbers to be k-perfect with the same k >= 2, and it is conjectured that such numbers are multiples of k!. It is very unlikely that an odd k-perfect number will ever be found, and even much less probable that it will be just next to an even k-perfect number. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 06 2020"
