    "comment": [
        "Super pseudoprimes to base 3 are Fermat pseudoprimes to base 3 all of whose composite divisors are also Fermat pseudoprimes to base 3. Therefore all the Fermat pseudoprimes to base 3 that are semiprimes are super pseudoprimes. This sequence contains the nontrivial terms of A328662, i.e. terms with at least one composite proper divisor.",
        "Feh\u00e9r and Kiss proved that there are infinitely many terms with 3 distinct prime factors (their proof was for all bases a > 1 that are not divisible by 4. Phong proved it for all bases a > 1).",
        "The first term, 7381, is not squarefree. What is the next such term?"
