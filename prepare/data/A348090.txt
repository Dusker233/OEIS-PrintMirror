    "comment": [
        "On a square grid place the numbers 1 to n in any order or position. If any two numbers are orthogonally adjacent those two numbers are added, and the sum over all these pair sums is then found. The sequence gives the maximum possible value of this sum when placing numbers from 1 up to n.",
        "Clearly, to maximize the sum all numbers should have one or more adjacent neighbors, and in general the larger numbers should be placed so that they appear in the most pairs so that their value contributes the most to the final sum. However, if two numbers have the same number of orthogonal neighbors then they can be switched since a number's contribution to the final sum is determined by the number of pairs it is in, not by the value of their pair neighbors."

The combinations with the largest pair sums are 1-3-2 and 2-3-1, the sum being (1+3)+(3+2) = 9. This is the largest sum as 3 is placed so that it is in two pairs and thus contributes twice to the sum.",
