        "The sequence is completely determined by its first 3 terms. If the first terms are x, y, z, then the following terms are 2*x-3*y+3*z, 6*x-7*y+6*z, 12*x-12*y+11*z, 22*x-21*y+21*z, 42*x-41*y+42*z, 84*x-84*y+85*z, 170*x-171*y+171*z, 342*x-343*y+342*z. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jun 21 2016",

        "From _Charlie Neder_, Jan 10 2019: (Start)",
        "No two terms among this sequence and its first and second differences are equal.",
        "Proof: Representing the first and second differences by b(n) and c(n), we have that a-b is [-1, -3, -2, 1, 3, 2] with period 6, a-c is [-3, -2, -1, 3, 2, 1] with period 6, and b-c is [-2, 1, 3, 2, -1, -3] with period 6. Therefore, no two terms at the same index are equal. Since the sequence is forced to grow exponentially, only the first few terms need to be checked to confirm that no two terms at different indices are equal, proving the criterion always holds. (End)"
