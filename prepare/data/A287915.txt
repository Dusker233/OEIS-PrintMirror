        "Sequence A007443, the binomial transform of the primes A000040, is defined as A007443(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} binomial(n-1,k-1)*prime(k). This is also the first column of the infinite square array T(m,n) with T(1,n) = prime(n) and T(m+1,n) = T(m,n) + T(m,n+1), as for binomial coefficients. Successive rows result from applying this operation of taking the sum of successive terms. So it would be more natural to use index 0 for the first term of this sequence (which is also the only even term, and results from applying the operation 0 times to the primes). This would yield the sequence 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 21, 24, 27, 31, 40, 98, 103, 137, 182, ...",
