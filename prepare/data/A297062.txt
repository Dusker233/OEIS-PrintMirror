        "With the restriction that no repeated digits are allowed, the sequence is finite and contains 10! + 1 terms. (Proof: The number of terms of length n is equal to n! - (n-1)! for 2 <= n <= 10.  Then the sum is telescopic, yielding 10! - 1!.  Adding the 2 initial terms we get the result.)  The smallest 10-digit term is 1023456789 and the last term of the sequence is 9876543210."
