        "By Murthy's trick, if k>2 is a product of factorials then k is a term. So half of the above conjecture is true: A001013 is a subsequence except for the number 2. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Nov 08 2004",
        "If there exists another term of this sequence not also in A001013, it must be >= 100000. - _Charlie Neder_, Oct 07 2018",
        "An additional term of this sequence not in A001013 must be > 5000000. Can it be shown that no such terms exist using results on consecutive smooth numbers? - _Charlie Neder_, Jan 14 2019"
