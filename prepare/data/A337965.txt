    "comment": [
        "Consider vertices numbered 0 thru 3n. Add the edges 0--3n, 1--3n, and either 0--(3n-k), 1--(3n-k+1), ... or k--(3n-k) for 2 <= k < 3n. (Altogether (3n-1)!/2 possibilities.) If the resulting graph has 2n vertices of degree 3, and n+1 isolated vertices, we have gracefully labeled a cubic graph of 2n vertices."
