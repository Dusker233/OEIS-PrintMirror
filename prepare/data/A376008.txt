        "In other words, for any three consecutive residues u,v,w, the quadratic polynomial u*x^2 + v*x + w has zero discriminant modulo p.",
        "It is shown that all suitable permutations q for prime p = a(n) can be constructed by starting with q(1) = 1, q(2) = a primitive root modulo p, and then defining q(k) = q(k-1)^2/(4*q(k-2)) mod p for k >= 3. Hence, the number of suitable permutations (up to cyclic rotations) is given by A046144(a(n))."
