        "This sequence is a subset of the numerators of a sequence of fractions converging to e which was obtained by the use of a program which searched for a fraction having a closer value to e than the preceding one. The initial terms of this sequence were 3/1, 5/2, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 49/18, 68/25, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 685/252, 878/323, 1071/394, 1264/465, 1457/536, 2721/1001, 12341/4540.
