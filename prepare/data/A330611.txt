        "A semi-magic knight's tour is a tour that adds to a constant sum in every line in one direction, but not in every line in the perpendicular direction. A near-magic tour is a special type of semi-magic tour in which the non-magic direction has the lines add to the magic constant and two other values. Such tours are of interest on boards where magic tours don't exist."
