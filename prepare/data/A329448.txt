        "Sequence A329447 is defined as above with n = 0, but one can take any other initial term n. This sequence lists those n which reappear later in the resulting sequence. To know whether n reappears, it is sufficient to compute the sequence up to the point where the last digit of n has appeared at least n/10 times. (The sequence may be not strictly increasing, but each subsequence of terms ending in the same digit is, ignoring the initial term.)",

        "All powers of 10 appear to be in the sequence, but this is only verified up to 10^7, not proved in general."

        "The numbers n = 12, ..., 19 reappear because they are, as initial term, followed by 11 for \"one '1' [has appeared so far]\"; thereafter the second digit of n will be the least frequent one, having appeared once, so the next term will be n for \"one (second digit of n) [has appeared so far]\".",
