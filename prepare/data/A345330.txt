        "For primes p, m^(2^v(p-1)+1) == -m (mod p) has only one solution m == 0 (mod p). This sequence gives that composite numbers that satisfy this condition.",

        "Odd composite k is a term if and only if v(p-1) <= v(k-1) for all prime factors p of k. Proof: Let k = (p_1)^(e_1)*(p_2)^(e_2)*...*(p_r)^(e_r) be an odd number. m^(2^v(k-1)+1) == -m (mod k) has only one solution if and only if m^(2^v(k-1)+1) == -m (mod (p_i)^(e_i)) has only one solution for 1 <= i <= r, or equivalently, m^(2^v(k-1)) == -1 (mod (p_i)^(e_i)) has no solution for 1 <= i <= r, or v(p_i-1) <= v(k-1) for 1 <= i <= r.",
