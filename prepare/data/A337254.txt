    "comment": [
        "The rook may move over squares it has already visited, only the final square after a full move must not have been visited before.",
        "As for A316667, the rook gets trapped as well. This happens after step 185 on square 118.",
        "Rook movement on the square spiral is also considered in A336447 and A336413.",
        "This is a variation of generalized knights, as in A323749, where here each move is a (x,0)-leaper but as opposed to A323749 the x changes depending on the current square rather than having a fixed size for each move."
