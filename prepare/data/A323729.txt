    "name": "Non-prime-powers k at which the variance of the first differences of the logarithms of the divisors of k, scaled by log(k), reaches a new minimum.",
    "comment": [
        "For any positive integer k, each divisor d of k and its complement q=k/d have as their geometric mean the value sqrt(d*q) = sqrt(d*k/d) = sqrt(k), so log(d), log(sqrt(k)), and log(q) form an arithmetic progression; consequently, the logarithms of the divisors of k are distributed symmetrically about log(sqrt(k)) = log(k)/2.",
        "If k is a prime power p^m (where p is prime and m >= 1), the divisors of k form the geometric progression {1, p, p^2, ..., p^m}, so the real-valued sequence consisting of their logarithms is the arithmetic progression {0, log(p), 2*log(p), ..., m*log(p)}, with constant difference log(p); if we divide that real-valued sequence by log(k), we get the rational-valued sequence {0, 1/m, 2/m, ..., 1} (an arithmetic progression with constant difference 1/m). If k is not a prime power, the differences between the logarithms of successive divisors of k will vary.",
        "Consider the question: For which non-prime-powers k are the divisors of k distributed most evenly (on a logarithmic scale)? One way to quantify the evenness of their distribution is to scale the logarithms of the divisors by dividing them by log(k) (to fit them to the interval [0,1]) and compute the population variance of their first differences. The non-prime-powers k at which this variance reaches a new minimum are the terms of this integer sequence.",
        "All terms in the sequence appear to be of the form p^m * q where p and q are prime and q is close to p^(m+1).",
        "Of the first 35 terms, all but 9 are odd semiprimes of the form k = p*(p^2 - 2); cf. A240436. Such numbers have 4 divisors -- in ascending order, d_1 = 1, d_2 = p, d_3 = p^2 - 2, and d_4 = p*(p^2 - 2) -- and as k increases, the values log(d_i)/log(k) approach {0, 1/3, 2/3, 1}.",
