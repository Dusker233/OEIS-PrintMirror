        "Also numbers k such that k is in A005279 but none of the proper divisors of k are.",
        "All terms k are composites; if k is prime then it's not in A005279 hence not here. If k = m * t and t < m < 2*t then m and t are coprime. If g = gcd(t, m) > 1 then the integer k / g^2 is in A005279. If there is some term u*t where with u > 2*t and gcd(u, t) = 1 then there is some m * t' with gcd(m, t') = 1 such that m*t' | t * u and t * u wouldn't be in the sequence. if u = 2*t then gcd(u, t) = t which can't happen.",
        "It could be that both m and t are composite, for example, t = 53^2 and m = 5^5 gives the term 53^2 * 5^5.",
        "Interestingly, k = m * t where t < m < 2 * t and m * t is in A005279 and m, t coprime gives A106430; this sequence is a subsequence of A106430."
