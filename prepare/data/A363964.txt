    "comment": [
        "For each such path there is a sequence of distinct vertices of the n-gon, each (except the last one) connected by a segment with the next vertex in the sequence; the segments have no common internal points. The path itself is the union of the set of these segments and is thus direction-independent: reversing the order of the vertices leads to the same path. If the sequence of vertices has length 1 then there are no segments; we call such a path a singleton."
