        "Consider the multivariate polynomial quotient ring K'_n = Z[x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n]/I where I = <x_1^2 - P_1, x_2^2 - P_2, ..., x_n^2 - P_n> is an ideal in Z[x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n]. Here, each polynomial P_i = -2x_i + x_{i+1} for 0 < i <= n, with x_{n+1} assumed to be 1. In this ring, every variable x_i for 0 < i <= n satisfies the recursive relation x_i^2 = -2x_i + x_{i+1}. The n-th term of this sequence is obtained by expanding the polynomial (2 + x_1)^n within the ring K'_n and evaluating at x_1 = x_2 = ... = x_n = 1. For a detailed explanation and proof, refer to Shunia's paper under links."
