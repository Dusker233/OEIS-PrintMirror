    "comment": [
        "Obviously all of x, y and z must be nonzero for all solutions N > 0. For any N = x*y*z = x+y+z, one gets -N from (-x, -y, -z), so considering only N >= 0 is not a restriction. Either none or exactly two among x, y and z must be negative.",
        "For given N, the problem amounts to finding fractions x and y such that x*y^2 + x*(x - N)*y + N = 0, which in turn corresponds to finding rational points on an elliptic curve."
