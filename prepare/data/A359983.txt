        "Bugeaud proves that the largest prime factor in a(n) increases without bound; in particular, for any e > 0 and all large n, the largest prime factor in a(n) is (1-e) * log log a(n) * log log log a(n) / log log log log a(n). So the largest prime factor in a(n) is more than k log n log log n/log log log n for any k < 1/3 and large enough n.",
