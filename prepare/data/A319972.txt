        "By analogy with the Wythoff compound sequences A003622 etc., the nine compounds of A003144, A003145, A003146 might be called the tribonacci compound sequences. They are A278040, A278041, and A319966-A319972.",
        "This sequence gives the positions of the word cabac in the tribonacci word t = abacabaa..., fixed point of the morphism a->ab, b->ac, c->a.  This follows from the fact that the positional sequences of cabaa, cabab and cabac give a splitting of the positional sequence of the word caba (the unique word in t with prefix the letter c), and that the three sets CA(N), CB(N) and CC(N), give a splitting of the set C(N), where A := A003144, B := A003145, C := A003146. Here N is the set of positive integers. - _Michel Dekking_, Apr 09 2019"
