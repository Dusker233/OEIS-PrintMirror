    "comment": [
        "Sequence A330614 has an interesting \"fractal\" structure of interleaved subsequences. It is computed in a nearly greedy manner as the lexicographically smallest sequence of distinct terms which has a certain property. One might expect that this yields a permutation of the positive integers, but it turns out that some numbers will never occur. These are listed here, in the hope that more can be found out about this subset.",
        "While the first terms are isolated, the sequence appears to have a density of > 3/5 already around n = 500, 2/3 around n = 1500, and almost 3/4 near n = 2*10^4. Is this the limiting density, or is it asymptotically increasing to a larger value?"
