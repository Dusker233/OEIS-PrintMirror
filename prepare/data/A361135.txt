    "comment": [
        "Edges are undirected, vertices not labeled. \"Fairly\" means that each vertex has degree 4, but two of these edges do not connect to a second vertex; they are \"fins\" in CAD speak or \"half-edges\" in perturbation theory. The two fins may be attached to the same or to two different nodes. In the usual mathematical nomenclature these are connected graphs of order n+2 with two vertices of degree 1 and n vertices of degree 4, loops allowed."
