        "The Suryanarayana paper contains these errors: In section 2, list (1) omits 3 and an asterisk should follow 1987; list (2) should include neither 3203 nor 3271. Section 3 should say \"Of the 339 primes d == 3 (4) up to 5000, 289 primes satisfy h(d) = 2, while 50 do not.\" (correcting all three counts) - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Apr 29 2015",
        "Also primes p > 2 such that Z[sqrt(p)] = Z[x]/(x^2 - p) is a unique factorization domain (or equivalently, a principal ideal domain). This can be deduced from the following result: let K be the quadratic field with discriminant D > 0, h(D) and h_+(D) be the ordinary class number and narrow class numer (or form class number) of K respectively, then h_+(D)/h(D) = 1 if the fundamental unit of K has norm -1; 2 if the fundamental unit of K has norm 1. - _Jianing Song_, Feb 17 2021"
