        "a(n) is also the minimum number of distinct palindromes (not counting the empty string) occurring as substrings of an n-bit binary string. For example, the string 11001 contains the five distinct palindromes 0, 00, 1, 11, and 1001. In fact, every 5-bit binary string contains five distinct palindromes, so a(5) = 5. - _Austin Shapiro_, Feb 15 2023"
