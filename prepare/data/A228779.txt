        "This sequence is based on the height of 183 cm of the Modular-man. For the sequence based on the earlier chosen height of 175 cm see A227572.",
        "Note that Le Corbusier uses other numbers in the figure found on p. 84 of the given reference and the figure on p. 51. The height of the navel is at 113 cm. This sequence is a variant (using phi) of Le Corbusier's so-called red (Fibonacci) series, see the reference, p. 84.",
        "Le Corbusier used on p. 84 of the Modulor reference the precise navel height 113 cm, and the so-called red series would then be A080105. However, the numbers and their rounding on p. 84 are slightly different, e.g., 774 instead of 775, and 5310 instead of 5309. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 05 2013"
