        "The One Up puzzle on a polyomino is defined in A371476. On a hypergraph, the objective of the puzzle is to assign a positive integer to each vertex in such a way that the vertices of each hyperedge are assigned consecutive numbers starting at 1. In other words, the vertex of a hyperedge of size 1 must be assigned the number 1, the vertices of a hyperedge of size 2 must be assigned the numbers 1 and 2, etc."
