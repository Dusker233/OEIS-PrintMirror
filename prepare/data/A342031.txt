    "comment": [
        "Bernardo Recam\u00e1n Santos (2015) showed that there is no run of more than 23 consecutive numbers, since numbers of the form 36*k - 6 and 36*k + 6 do not have distinct exponents. Pace Nielsen and _Adam P. Goucher_ showed that there can be only finitely many runs of 23 consecutive numbers (see MathOverflow link).",
        "Akta\u015f and Ram Murty (2017) gave an explicit upper bound to such a run of 23 numbers. They found the first 5 terms of this sequence (and stated that there are a few more known up to 7*10^8), and said that we may conjecture (based on numerical evidence) that there are no 6 consecutive numbers."
