        "Complement in A005843 of A309239. Every odd number > 1 has the property mentioned in Name, but these are the only even numbers with this property. No term is either a power of 2 or a semiprime. A number m is a term if and only if m = 2rp, where r >= 2, and p is a prime > q, the smallest prime divisor of 2r-1 (k=p-q). For any given r, 2rz is the smallest multiple of 2r in this sequence, where z=nextprime(q). If m = 2rp is a term and 2r-1 is prime, then p is the greatest prime divisor of m (the converse is not true; e.g., m=70=10*7)."
