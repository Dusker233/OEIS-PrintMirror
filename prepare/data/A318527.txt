        "Proof: since -3 is not a quadratic residue modulo any prime == 5 (mod 6) we have k == 1 (mod 5) and k == 0 or 1 (mod 6). If k is even, then k == 6 (mod 30). -3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 9 so k == 3 (mod 9), then k == 66 (mod 90), k + 3 = 90*t + 69 = 3*(30*t + 23) but 30*t + 23 == 5 (mod 6), so -3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 30*t + 23, a contradiction. Thus k must be odd, then k == 1 (mod 30). For the same reason k == 1 or 4 (mod 9). If k == 4 (mod 9), then k == 31 (mod 90), k + 2 = 90*t + 33 = 3*(30t + 11) but 30*t + 11 == 5 (mod 6), a contradiction. So k == 1 (mod 9), then k == 1 (mod 90). If k == 91 (mod 180), then k + 3 = 180*t + 94 = 2*(90*t + 47) but 90*t + 47 == 5 (mod 6), a contradiction. So k == 1 (mod 180). -3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 8 so k == 1, 2, 3 or 4 (mod 8), thus k == 1 (mod 360) which is what we wanted.",
        "(b) k is a term iff -3 is a quadratic residue modulo k*(k + 1)*(k + 2)*(k + 3)/2.",
        "Proof: \"<=\" is obvious, since k*(k + 1)*(k + 2)*(k + 3)/2 is multiple of k, k + 1, k + 2 and k + 3. \"=>\": Note that -3 is a quadratic residue modulo lcm(k, k + 1, k + 2, k + 3). Now we show that lcm(k, k + 1, k + 2, k + 3) = k*(k + 1)*(k + 2)*(k + 3)/2. If not, then k is a multiple of 3, but by (a) we have k == 1 (mod 3), a contradiction."
