        "A number's prime signature (row n of A124010) is the sequence of positive exponents in its prime factorization.",
        "Also numbers whose multiset of prime factors is not weakly alternating, where we define a sequence to be weakly alternating if it is alternately weakly increasing and weakly decreasing, starting with either. This sequence looks at the somewhat degenerate case where no strict decreases are allowed."
