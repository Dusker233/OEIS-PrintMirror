        "For n = 3, since there are 6 embeddings of the square into the boundary and 6 embeddings of the square into the interior of the 3-cube, there are 12 affine dependences on squares; moreover, there is an affine dependence for each of the 8 vertices of the 3-cube coming from the intersection of the line from that vertex to the vertex opposite in the 3-cube with the triangle spanned by the neighbors of that vertex; this adds up to a total of 20 affine dependencies."
