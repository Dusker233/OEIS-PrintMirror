        "A subsequence of A064224. This sequence gives solutions P to the equation P = (x+1)...(x+m) = (y+1)...(y+n) with x>0, y>0 and x+m < y+1. So far, no numbers P with more than two representations have been discovered. Note that the only the lowest range of consecutive numbers (x+1 to x+m) can contain prime numbers; the other ranges are in a gap between consecutive primes. Gaps between the first 45000 primes were searched for additional terms, but none were found."
