        "The prime numbers of the form p = (10^m-3)*10^k + 1 with k > m > 0 are terms of this sequence. Note that this includes primes of the form 7 * 10^k + 1 with k >=2 described in the first comment above. The squares are of the form p^2 = (10^m-3)^2*10^(2*k) + 2(10^m-3)*10^k + 1. Note that (10^m-3)^2 = 10^m(10^m-6)+9 which only contains the digits 0, 4 and 9. Similarly, 2*(10^m-3) = 2*10^m-6 which only contains the digits 1, 9 and 4 and has m+1 <= k decimal digits. Thus p^2 only contains the digits 0, 1, 4, 9. Some examples include (m,k) = (2,3), (2,8), (2,15), (3,4), (3,18), (4,71), (5,20), (6,7), ...",
