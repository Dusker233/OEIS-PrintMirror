        "The inventory sequence A342585 counts, for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., the k's that have occurred so far, and if zero, restarts with k = 0. The rows end where the zeros occur.",
        "The sequence appears to grow approximately quadratically. More precisely, b(n) = sqrt(a(n)) is roughly a straight line over increasingly large intervals, but the slope is slightly larger at the beginning and then decreasing towards the end of these intervals. For example, on [1..80] the slope is almost exactly 0.72; on [150..250] the slope is roughly 1.0, over [320..420] the slope is again 0.8, over [430..520] it is again 1.0, over [530..620] it is again 0.8; then the slope increases: b(780..1000) is again a nearly straight line with slope 1.67, etc. - _M.
