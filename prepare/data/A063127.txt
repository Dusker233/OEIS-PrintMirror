        "This is also the set of highest rolls that can be made with some number of platonic dice (dice which are platonic solids, considered to be the most \"fair\" dice). For instance, 22 is the highest roll with a die which is a dodecahedron, a cubic die, and a tetrahedral die. - _Joshua R. Tint_, Sep 08 2020",
