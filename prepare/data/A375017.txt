    "comment": [
        "All rational isosceles triangles are the join of two identical rational right triangles along one of their common legs. Therefore, for any g, a squarefree congruent number, it can be the area of the right triangle creating a rational isosceles triangle with area 2g. If g is odd then the rational isosceles triangle will have squarefree k = 2g. If g is even then the rational isosceles triangle can be reduced by a factor 4 to give a squarefree value for k = g/2."

        "The congruent number 5 can create a rational right triangle with sides (9/6, 40/6, 41/6)) and squarefree area 5. This can create a rational isosceles triangle with sides (41/6, 41/6, 9/6) or (41/6, 41/6, 40/6) with squarefree area 10.",
        "However the congruent number 6 can create a rational right triangle with sides (3, 4, 5)) and squarefree area 6. This can create a rational isosceles triangle with sides (6/2, 5/2, 5/2) or (8/2, 5/2, 5/2) with squarefree area 3."
