        "The reverse-alternating sum of a partition (y_1,...,y_k) is Sum_i (-1)^(k-i) y_i.",
        "Also the number of reversed of integer partitions of n with alternating sum < 0.",
        "No integer partitions have alternating sum < 0, so the non-reversed version is all zeros.",
        "Is this sequence weakly increasing? Note: a(2n + 2) = A236914(n), a(2n) = A344743(n).",
        "A formula for the reverse-alternating sum of a partition is: (-1)^(k-1) times the number of odd parts in the conjugate partition, where k is the number of parts. So a(n) is the number of integer partitions of n of even length whose conjugate parts are not all odd. Partitions of the latter type are counted by A086543. By conjugation, a(n) is also the number of integer partitions of n of even maximum whose parts are not all odd."
