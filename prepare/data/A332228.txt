        "Proof that any odd perfect number, if such numbers exist at all, has to reside in this sequence: As all terms in A228058 are = 1 modulo 4 (their binary expansion ends as \"01\"), and taking sigma of an odd perfect number would multiply it by two (shift one bit-position left), the base-2 expansion of that result would end as \"010\"), i.e., sigma(k) modulo 8 should be 2 (not 6) for such numbers k."
