        "For polynomial sequences like A000127 we can always find a recurrence formula, and with that you can show that all polynomial sequences mod m will be periodic. Terms of this sequence were found using A000127(k) mod 2^x, with a recursion formula, treating each k separately. This method limits the size of working quantities.",
        "This sequence is related to the question: Is there a another power of 2 among Moser's circle numbers?"
