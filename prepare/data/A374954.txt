        "This sequence is finite. Proof: First, let's assume that p_1 = ... = p_r = p, i.e. k = p^r. Then sqrt(p^r) < r*sqrt(p) or p < r^(2/(r-1)) respectively must apply. This inequality is satisfied for p = 2 and 2 <= r <= 6 as well as for p = 3 and r = 2. k can therefore contain at most r = 6 prime factors and is not a prime. By examining the individual ways for the highest value of k as a function of r, we find k = 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 for r = 6, k = 2*2*2*2*3 = 48 for r = 5, 2*2*2*5 = 40 for r = 4, 2*2*7 = 28 for r = 3 and 2*11 = 22 for r = 2. Therefore, this sequence is finite and its terms lie between 4 and 64."
