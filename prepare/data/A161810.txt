        "The original source for this sequence was the problem 'perlbrac' in the 2009 USACO Holiday Contest (http://ace.delos.com/HOL09) which asked contestants to find the longest sequences of this type that they possibly could. a(n) is the upper bound on the length of such a sequence for a given n."
