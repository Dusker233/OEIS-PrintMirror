        "The sequence is infinite if one considers numbers like 10........010 (with N zeros between ones, N = 0, 1, 2, ...). The problem of looking for odd terms and zerofree terms remains. Still unclear is whether the sequence contains infinitely many zerofree terms. The proportions between numbers of N-digit numbers included in the sequence need to be explored."
