        "It appears that when 2*A019505(n) is a member of this sequence then the exponent in at least one primary of the factorization of A019505(n+1) is smaller than in the corresponding primary of A019505(n) or A019505(n+1) contains an additional prime factor. The smallest example in this sequence where two primaries have smaller exponents and an additional prime factor is added is a(14) = 2*A019505(43) = 2 * 97772875200 = 195545750400. The sequence of exponents of its primaries is (7, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 ) while A019505(44) = 160626866400 has exponent sequence (5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ). - _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Feb 22 2023"
