        "Conjecture. The terms of this sequence are given by the positions of 2 in the fixed-point of the morphism 0 -> 01, 1 -> 02, 2 -> 03, 3 -> 01 (see A191255). (This has been confirmed for over 5000 terms of A213257.) To illustrate, the fixed-point of the indicated morphism is {0,1,0,2,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,...} and 2 occurs at positions {4,12,20,...}, integers in this sequence but missing from A213257.",
        "It appears that the terms of this sequence are all of the form of 4 times an odd integer multiplied by a nonnegative power of 8.",
        "The above two conjectures are correct. This is indeed positions of 2 in A191255, and numbers of the form 2^(3t+2)*s where s is an odd number. - _Jianing Song_, Sep 21 2018"
