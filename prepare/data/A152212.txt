        "Blocks of successive numbers n has length 1 or 2 or 3. No block with length > 3 found. Blocks with length 1 are of the form [n odd], no 1-block for n even found, blocks with length 2 are of the form [n,n+1] and are relatively rare, blocks of length 3 are of the form [n-1,n even,n+1]. Example: [1],[3],[5],[7],[11,12,13],[15,16,17],[19,20,21],[23],[27],[29],[31],[33],[35],[37],[39],[41],[43,44],... For some n we have c a square. This is valid for n from {1,3,15,19,20,39,73,81,123,163,267,692,883,...} not in OEIS.",
        "476 is the smallest even number in the sequence such that n-1 and n+1 are both not in the sequence. Up to 4000000, the sequence contains no n == 2 (mod 4), which if it holds up implies that every run of 3 starts with an odd number (in fact, n == 3 (mod 4)), and that there are no runs of 4. It appears, based on congruence arguments mod powers of 2, that no n == 2 (mod 4) is possible, but I am not sure that I can actually prove this. [_Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Nov 08 2009]"
