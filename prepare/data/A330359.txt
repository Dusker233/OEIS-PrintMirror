        "All the terms are even by definition. For each term m, there are m/2 lucky numbers of the form 4*k - 1 and m/2 lucky numbers of the form 4*k + 1 up to the m-th lucky number.",
        "Gardiner et al. (1956) noted that the ratio between the numbers of lucky numbers of the form 4*k - 1 and 4*k + 1 seems to tend to 1, with a preponderance, at first, of the lucky numbers of the form 4*k + 3."
