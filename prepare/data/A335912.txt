        "Numbers n such that when we start from k = n, and apply in some combination the nondeterministic maps k -> k - k/p and k -> k + k/p, (where p can be any of the odd prime factors of k), then for some combination we can reach a power of 2 in exactly two steps (but with no combination allowing 0 or 1 steps)."

        "For n = 70 = 2*5*7, if we first take p = 7 and apply the map n -> n + (n/p), we obtain 80 = 2^4 * 5. We then take p = 5, and apply the map n -> n - (n/p), to obtain 80-16 = 64 = 2^16. Thus we reached a power of 2 in two steps (and there are no shorter paths), therefore 70 is present in this sequence.",
        "For n = 769, which is a prime, 769 - (769/769) yields 768 = 3 * 256. For 768 we can then apply either map to obtain a power of 2, as 768 - (768/3) = 512 = 2^9 and 768 + (768/3) = 1024 = 2^10. On the other hand, 769 + (769/769) = 770 and A335885(770) = 4, so that route would not lead to any shorter paths, therefore 769 is a term of this sequence."
