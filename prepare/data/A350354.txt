        "We define a pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670 and ranked by A333217. A patten is up/down if it is alternately strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, starting with an increase.",
        "A pattern is up/down if it is alternately strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, starting with an increase. For example, the partition (3,2,2,2,1) has no up/down permutations, even though it does have the anti-run permutation (2,3,2,1,2).",
