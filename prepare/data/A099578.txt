        "We clarify the above comment by T. D. Noe. The number of compositions of N into K positive parts is C(N-1, K-1). This was proved by MacMahon in 1893 (and probably by others before him). The number of compositions of N into K nonnegative parts is C(N+K-1, K-1) because for every composition b_1 + ... + b_K = N with b_i >= 0 for all i, we may create another composition c_1 + ... + c_K = N+K with c_i = b_i + 1 >= 1.",
        "The statement of T. D. Noe above means that, for n>=2, a(n-2) is the number of compositions of N = n-1 into K = floor(n/2) nonnegative parts. Thus, a(n-2) = C(N+K-1, K-1) = C(n-1+floor(n/2)-1, floor(n/2)-1) = C(floor((3(n-2)+2)/2), floor((n-2)/2)).",
        "This interpretation is important for T. D. Noe's comments for sequence A030077, whose unknown general formula remains an unsolved problem (as of July 2018).",
        "It should be noted, however, that for most authors \"composition\" means \"composition into positive parts\". The phrase \"weak composition\" is sometimes used for a \"composition into nonnegative parts\".",
