    "name": "a(n) is the number of preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women where both the men's and the women's preferences form a Latin square when arranged in a matrix. In addition, it is possible to arrange all people into n man-woman couples such that they rank each other first.",
    "comment": [
        "Two people who rank each other first are called soulmates. Thus, the profiles in this sequence have n pairs of soulmates.",
        "The profiles with n pairs of soulmates are counted by sequence A343698. The profiles such that the men's preferences form a Latin square are counted by A343696. The profiles such that both men's and women's preferences form a Latin square are counted by A343697. The profiles in this sequence are the intersection of profiles in A343698 and A343697.",
        "Both the men- and the women-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm on the preference profiles described by this sequence end in one round."

After that, the women's preference profiles form a Latin square with a fixed first column, as the first column is uniquely defined to generate 3 pairs of soulmates. Thus, there are A002860(3)/3! = 12/6 = 2 ways to set up the women's preference profiles, making a(3) = 12 * 2 = 24 preference profiles."
