        "A rich word w is one that contains, as contiguous subwords, exactly n nonempty palindromes, where n is the length of w.  An infinite word is rich if all of its (contiguous) subwords are rich.  By a theorem of Glen, Justin, Widmer, and Zamboni (below), a(n) is also the number of length-n binary words w such that the infinite word www... is rich.  And also the number of length-n binary words w that are products of two palindromes, where all the conjugates of w are rich."
