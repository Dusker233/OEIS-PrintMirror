        "Indeed, more is true. Let L denote the (2*n - 1) X (2*n - 1) square lattice graph with vertices (i,j), 1 <= i,j <= 2*n-1. Call a vertex (i,j) odd if both coordinates i and j are odd. Then there is a bijection between the set of spanning trees on the square n X n grid and the set of domino tilings of L with an odd boundary point removed. See Tzeng and Wu, 2002. This is a divisibility sequence, i.e., if n divides m then a(n) divides a(m). - _Peter Bala_, Apr 29 2014",
        "Also, a(n) is the order of the sandpile group of the (n-1)X(n-1) grid graph. This is because the n X n grid is dual to (n-1)X(n-1) grid + sink vertex, and the latter is related to the sandpiles by the burning bijection. See J\u00e1rai, Sec. 4.1, or Redig, Sec. 2.2. In _M. F. Hasler_'s comment below, index n refers to the size of the grid underlying the sandpile. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Mar 27 2018",

        "The sandpile addition (+) of two n X n matrices is defined as the ordinary addition, followed by the topple-process in which each element larger than 3 is decreased by 4 and each of its von Neumann neighbors is increased by 1.",
        "For any n, there is a neutral element e_n such that the set S(n) = { A in M_n({0..3}) | A (+) e_n = A } of matrices invariant under sandpile addition of e_n, forms a group, i.e., each element A in S(n) has an inverse A' in S(n) such that A (+) A' = e_n. (For n > 1, e_n cannot be the zero matrix O_n, because for this choice S(n) would include, e.g., the all 1's matrix 1_n which cannot have an inverse X such that 1_n (+) X = O_n. The element e_n is the unique nonzero matrix such that e_n (+) e_n = e_n.)",
        "The present sequence lists the size of the abelian group (S(n), (+), e_n). See the example section for the e_n. The elements of S(2) are listed as A300006 and their inverses are listed as A300007. (End)"
