        "Note that in Geoffrey's example (in which there's no central summand) all 8 compositions of 6=3*2 are either palindromes or can be rearranged into palindromes. The compositions of 2*2=4 with even multiplic1ty are 2+2 and 1+1+1+1, and are counted by a(2). Adding a fixed, central summand of 2, yields 2 more palindrome-capable compositions of 6: 2+2+2 and 1+1+2+1+1. The composition of 2*1=2 with even multiplicity is 1+1. Adding a fixed, central summand of 4 yields 1 more palindrome composition of 6: 1+4+1. Finally, the bare central summand of 6 is counted by a(0)=1. Hence, the total number of  compositions of 6 that are palindrome capable is a(0)+...+a(3), if the central summand is fixed. This sum also gives the total number of palindrome-capable compositions of 7, employing fixed, central summands of 1,3,5 and 7. _Gregory L. Simay_, Nov 27 2018"
