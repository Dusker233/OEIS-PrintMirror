    "comment": [
        "Start with a complete bipartite graph K(6,n) with vertex sets A and B where |A| = 6 and |B| is at least 3. We can arrange the points in sets A and B such that h(A,B) = d(a,b) for all a in A and b in B, where h is the Hausdorff metric. The pair [A,B] is a configuration. Then a set C is between A and B at location s if h(A,C) = h(C,B) = h(A,B) and h(A,C) = s. Call a pair ab, where a is in A and b is in B an edge. This sequence provides the number of sets between sets A' and B' at location s in a new configuration [A',B'] obtained from [A,B] by removing two edges, where the two removed edges are not incident to the same point in A but are incident to the same point in B.  So this sequence tells the number of sets at each location on the line segment between A' and B'.",
