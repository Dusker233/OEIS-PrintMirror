Because A057500(4)=15, and knowing that there are 3 labeled squares, we have 15-3 = 12 Paw Graphs [see Weisstein link]. So graph 1 is labeled in 12 * C(8,4) = 840 ways. Graph 2 is labeled in 3* C(8,4) = 210 ways. A105599 gives 10 as the number of labeled forests with 5 nodes and 4 components, so graph 3 is labeled in 10 * C(8,3) = 560 ways.
