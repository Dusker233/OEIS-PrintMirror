        "Boyd and Kisilevsky in 1972 proved that there exist only 3 solutions (x,y) = (2,1), (4,2), (55,19) to the Diophantine equation x * (x+1) * (x+2) = y * (y+1) * (y+2) * (y+3) [see the reference and a proof in the link].",
        "A similar result: in 1963, L. J. Mordell proved that (x,y) = (2,1), (14,5) are the only 2 solutions to the Diophantine equation x * (x+1) = y * (y+1) * (y+2) with 2*3 = 1*2*3 = 6 and 14*15 = 5*6*7 = 210."
