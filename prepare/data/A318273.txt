        "For example, 27 is in A299690 and has multiplicative root 4. 27 has the additive root 9. Prepending 4 ones gives the number 111127 which has multiplicative root 4, the same as 27 has, but it also has an additive root of 4. Furthermore, the digits are in nondecreasing order hence is in this sequence."
