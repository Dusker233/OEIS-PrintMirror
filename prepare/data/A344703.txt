We can say more, since for prime p and positive integer e, psi(p^(2*e)) = p^(2*e-1) * (p+1), whereas sigma(p^(2*e)) can be shown to be congruent to 1 modulo p and to 1 modulo p+1, so shares no factors with p^(2*e-1) * (p+1). So all terms are divisible by more than one prime.",

        "Looking in particular at the shared factor 3, we see it is present in sigma(7^2) and psi(2^2). For prime p, sigma(p^2) and psi(p^2) equate to polynomials in p, so we deduce 3 divides sigma(p^2) for p congruent to 7 modulo 3, and divides psi(p^2) for p congruent to 2 modulo 3. From this we see all products of a prime of the form 3m+1 and a prime of the form 3m+2 are in the sequence; for instance (3*4+1) * (3*1+2) = 13 * 5 = 65."
