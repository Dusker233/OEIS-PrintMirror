        "Suppose that n has base-b digits b(m), b(m-1), ..., b(0).  The base-b down-variation of n is the sum DV(n,b) of all d(i)-d(i-1) for which d(i) > d(i-1); the base-b up-variation of n is the sum UV(n,b) of all d(k-1)-d(k) for which d(k) < d(k-1).  The total base-b variation of n is the sum TV(n,b) = DV(n,b) + UV(n,b).  See the guide at A297330."
