        "Let ABC be a triangle with sidelengths a,b,c.  Treating a,b,c as variables, a polynomial triangle center is defined to be a point with barycentric coordinates of the form f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), where p(a,b,c) is a polynomial satisfying these two conditions (homogeneity and bisymmetry):",
        "     f(t*a, t*b, t*c) = t^n * f(a,b,c), where n is the degree of the polynomial;",
        "     f(a,b,c) = f(a,c,b).",
        "Examples include the incenter, I = a : b : c, the centroid, G = 1 : 1 : 1, and the circumcenter, O = f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) = a^2 (b^2 + c^2 - a^2).",
        "The Nagel line of ABC is the line IG, which consists of all points x:y:z: such that (b-c)*x + (c-a)*y + (a-b)*z = 0.",
        "The complement of a point P is the point U such that PU : UG = 3 : -1.  If P has barycentric coordinates p : q : r, then its complement is U = q+r : r+p : p+q.",
        "For n >= 1, Kimberling found a basis for polynomials triangle centers of degree n on the Nagel line; the basis consists of symmetric polynomials of degree n and a*(symmetric polynomials of degree n-1.",
        "Seeing that complement is a linear transformation on the vector space of polynomial triangle centers of degree n, we can represent it as a matrix, which we call the \"complement matrix for polynomial triangle centers of degree n\".",
        "The eigenvalues are 2 and -1 with multiplicity A001399(n) and A001399(n-1) respectively.",
        "In homogenous barycentric coordinates, the points p:q:r and kp:kq:kr are the same, hence the eigenvectors are the fixed points of the complement transformation applied to polynomial triangle centers on the Nagel line. Although there are more than 2 eigenvectors, there are only 2 fixed points, the centroid and the intersection of the Nagel line and the line at infinity (the points m:m:m, where m is a symmetric function of a, b, c is the same as the centroid (1:1:1), this is why the same point appears as different eigenvectors). The eigenvalues associated with the centroid as a fixed point are equal to 2, and the eigenvalues associated with the point at infinity as the fixed point are equal to -1."
