    "comment": [
        "Each node can be in one of two states, ON or OFF. The automaton is totalistic, meaning that the state of a node in the next generation depends only on the number of ON-nodes among its neighbors. Since there are finitely many states of the automaton, it will eventually enter a cycle. a(n) is the maximum of the length of that cycle, over all connected graphs with n nodes, all totalistic updating rules, and all initial states."
