        "Let F be the number field of degree n over which some relevant elliptic curve E is defined. Torsion subgroup refers to the torsion subgroup E(F)_{tors} of finite order F-rational points of E.",
        "By a result of Pierre Parent building on the work of Merel Lo\u00efc, Barry Mazur, Andrew Ogg and others, the maximal p-power order of an F-rational point of E for any prime p is effectively bounded by P(n) = 129*(5^n-1)*(3n)^6. By a structure result behind the Mordell-Weil theorem -- E(F)_{tors} is isomorphic as an abelian group to Z/aZ x Z/bZ for some positive integers a, b -- the n-th term is effectively bounded by a(n) <= (P(n)^P(n))^2. While slightly better bounds exist, all bounds known as of 2024 are of a doubly exponential nature."
