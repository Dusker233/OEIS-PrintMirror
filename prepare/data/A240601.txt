        "A number n with m digits in base 10 is a member if n is a palindrome, and the first floor(m/2) digits of n is already a previous term of a(n). All repdigit numbers are terms of a(n). Fast generation of new terms with 2m digits can be done by concatenating the previous terms with m digits twice. Fast generation of new terms with 2m+1 digits can be done by concatenating the previous terms with m digits twice with any single digit in the middle. The smallest palindrome which is not a member of a(n) is 1001."
