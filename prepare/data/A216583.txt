        "A unit-conjoined polydomino is formed from n 1 X 2 non-overlapping rectangles (or dominoes) such that each pair of touching rectangles shares an edge of length 1. The internal arrangement of dominoes is not significant: figures are counted as distinct only if the shapes of their perimeters are different.",
        "Figures that differ only by a rotation and/or reflection are regarded as equivalent (cf. A216595).",
        "This sequence is A216492 without the condition that the adjacency graph of the dominoes forms a tree.",
        "This is a subset of polydominoes. It appears that A216492(n) < a(n) < A056785(n) < A056786(n) < A210996(n) < A210988(n) < A210986(n), if n >= 3. - _Omar E. Pol_, Sep 17 2012"
