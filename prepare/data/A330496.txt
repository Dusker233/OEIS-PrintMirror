    "comment": [
        "If a, b, c, d are consecutive odd primes configured as a cyclic quadrilateral, then Brahmagupta's formula K = sqrt((a+b+c-d)(a+b-c+d)(a-b+c+d)(-a+b+c+d))/16 means that K^2 will always be an integer. The only cyclic quadrilateral with consecutive prime sides starting with side 2 has a rational squared area of 3003/16."
