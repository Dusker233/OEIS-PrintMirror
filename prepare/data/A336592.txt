        "Numbers such that none of the exponents in their prime factorization is of the form 4*m + 3.",
        "Cohen (1963) proved that for a given number k > 2 the asymptotic density of numbers whose exponents in their prime factorization are not of the forms k*m - 1 is zeta(k)/zeta(k-1). In this sequence k = 4, and therefore its asymptotic density is zeta(4)/zeta(3) = Pi^4/(90*zeta(3)) = 0.9003926776..."
