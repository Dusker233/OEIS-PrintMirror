        "This sequence gives all solutions of one of two classes of positive proper solutions a(n) = a1(n) of the Pell equation a(n)^2 - 5*b(n) = -4 with b(n) = b1(n) = Fibonacci(6*n+1) = A134493(n). These solutions are obtained from the fundamental positive solution [1, 1] (to be read as a column vector) by application of positive powers of the automorphic matrix A = matrix([9, 20], [4, 9]) with determinant +1.",
        "The other class of positive proper solutions is obtained similarly from the fundamental solution [11,5] and is given by [a5(n), b5(n)], with a5(n) = A305316(n) and b5(n) = A134497(n) = F(6*n+5), with the Fibonacci numbers F = A000045.",
        "The remaining positive solutions are improper and are obtained by application of the same matrix A on the fundamental improper solution [4, 2]. They are given by [a3(n), b3(n)], with a3(n) = 4*A049629(n) and b3(n) = A134495(n) = 2*A007805(n).",
        "Via the Cayley-Hamilton theorem the powers of the automorphic matrix A are: A^n = matrix([S(n) - 9*S(n-1), 20*S(n-1)], [4*S(n-1), S(n) - 9*S(n-1)]) with the Chebyshev polynomials S(n-1) = S(n-1, x=18) = A049660(n), n >= 0.",
        "This shows that ordered Markoff (Markov) triples [1, y, m], with 1 <= y <= m, have for m  from the union of sets {m1(k)}_{k>=0} U {m5(k)}_{k>=0) U {m3(k)}_{k>=0)}, with mj(k) = F(6*k+j), for j = 1, 5, and 3, the unique solutions yj(k) = (3*F(6*k+j) - aj(k))/2  < mj(k), namely y1(k) = F(6*k-1) = A134497(k-1) with F(-1) = 1,  y5(k) = F(6*k+3) = A134495(k) and y3(k) = F(6*k+1) = A134493. The solutions with the + sign are excluded because they are > mj(k). This trisection of the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers as m numbers shows again the well known fact that each of them appears as largest member in a Markoff triple if the smallest member is x = 1. The positions of the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers in the Markoff sequence A002559 are given in A158381. The conjecture in this case is that the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers appear as largest numbers only in the ordered Markov triples with x = 1. See, e.g., the Aigner reference for the general Frobenius-Markoff conjecture.",
