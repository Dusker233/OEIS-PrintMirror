        "Also the number of subsets of {1,2,...,n} that contain more odd than even numbers.  For example, for n=4, a(4)=5 and the 5 subsets are {1}, {3}, {1,3}, {1,2,3}, {1,3,4}. See A014495 when same number of even and odd numbers. - _Enrique Navarrete_, Feb 10 2018",
        "Also half the number of length-n binary sequences with a different number of zeros than ones. This is also the number of integer compositions of n with nonzero alternating sum, where the alternating sum of a sequence (y_1,...,y_k) is Sum_i (-1)^(i-1) y_i. Also the number of integer compositions of n+1 with alternating sum <= 0, ranked by A345915 (reverse: A345916). - _Gus Wiseman_, Jul 19 2021"
