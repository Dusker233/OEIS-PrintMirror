    "comment": [
        "Position refers to the digit where there required sequence (0, ..., n-1) starts. Position = k means the digit '0' occurs as digit corresponding to the weight n-^k (and thereafter, the digit '1' will correspond to n^-(k+1) etc): e.g., the first digit after the decimal point has position 1."
