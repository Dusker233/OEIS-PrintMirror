        "I have searched up to the 9 millionth prime, 160481183 and gave up trying to find a third term. The sequence is conjectured to be infinite. If the behavior is similar to base 10, A045616, then the next term could be greater than 2*10^11. In base 12 with X for ten and E for eleven the sequence is [1685, 5E685] so it would be interesting to see if the third term ends in 685 as well. These primes are also the Wieferich numbers in base 12: 12^phi(n) = 1 mod n^2.",
