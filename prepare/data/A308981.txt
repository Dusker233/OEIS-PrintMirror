        "Apart the three initial terms which lead to +/-1, all other terms lead to prime P(k) = k^3 - 2*k^2 + k - 1.",
        "The polynomial Q = (((x^2-k)^2-k)^2-x-k)/(x^2 - x - k) of degree 6 has two factors of degree <= 3 when k is in A014206. This can only happen when the constant term of Q, which equals -P(k), is not prime. Therefore, A014206 is a subsequence of the complement of this sequence."
