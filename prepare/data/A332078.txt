        "It appears that the sequence of odd numbers k*2^m+1 such that k + 2^m is prime (A332075) mainly consists of the primes. This sequence lists the \"exceptions\": the complement of A332075 within the primes. (The exceptions become more frequent as the numbers grow, the asymptotic density of this subset within the primes might well approach one. See also A332079.)",
        "These are primes of the form p = (w-2^m)*2^m + 1, where w is an odd composite number and 1 < 2^m < w. There are infinitely many primes of this form, because all primes p > 7 such that p == 7 (mod 20) are in this sequence. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Aug 13 2020"
