        "Yes, this is a duplicate of A038883. For primes p congruent to {1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12} mod 13, they split in the quadratic field Q(sqrt(13)). Since Z[(1+sqrt(13))/2], the ring of integers of Q(sqrt(13)), is a UFD, they are reducible in Z[(1+sqrt(13))/2], so we have p = +-((u' + v'*sqrt(13))/2)*((u' - v'*sqrt(13))/2) = +-(u'^2 - 13*v'^2)/4, where u', v' have the same parity. Since there are elements in Z[(1+sqrt(13))/2] with norm -1 (for example, (3+sqrt(13))/2), we can suppose that p = (u'^2 - 13*v'^2)/4. If u', v' are even, then pick u = u'/2, v = v'/2 and we have p = u^2 - 13*v^2; if u', v' are odd, pick u = (11*u'+-39*v')/4, v = (3*u'+-11*v')/4 by choosing signs appropriately so that u, v are integers.",
        "On the other hand, u^2 - 13*v^2 == 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12 (mod 13). So these two sequences are the same.",
