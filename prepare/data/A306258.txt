        "In this sequence, however, the displacement is calculated differently: that of \"0123\" is 0 as before, but the displacement of \"3210\" is no longer 8 because the first index and last index are connected, forming a loop; each of the digits 0 and 3 is now 1 place away from its original place (and each of the digits 1 and 2 is one place away, as before), so the total displacement is calculated as 1+1+1+1 = 4."
