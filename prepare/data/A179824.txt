        "To generate a Pythagorean triangle one uses (a,b) to get sides b^2-a^2, 2*a*b, and a^2+b^2, having a perimeter of 2*b*(a+b). If for a one uses the triangular number n*(n+1)/2 and for b the next triangular number (n+1)*(n+2)/2, the perimeter of the triangle so formed is (n+1)^3 * (n+2), which will give the same results as this sequence starting at the second term. - _J. M. Bergot_, Apr 01 2012",
        "Define b(0)=0 and b(n)=A179824(n+1) for n > 0. Then b(n) is the number of 4-tuples (w,x,y,z) having all terms in {0,...,n} and no two consecutive terms equal. - _Clark Kimberling_, May 31 2012",
        "Let n points in the plane each become the centers of n-1 concentric circles, circles that pass through only one of each of the other points. The maximum number of intersections of these circles is this sequence. [The solution was given by _Andrew Weimholt_ in the Sequence Fans Mailing List] - _J. M. Bergot_, Mar 10 2014",
        "Both the 'claw graph', a graph with 4 vertices where one vertex is adjacent to the other three, and the path graph on 4 vertices (per _Clark Kimberling_'s comment), have this sequence as their chromatic polynomial, or the number of proper colorings of the graph using at most n colors. This is the standard example of two graphs which are not isomorphic, but which have the same chromatic polynomial."
