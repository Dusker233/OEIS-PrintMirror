        "Putting the number on a circle and going clockwise, we observe that a 0 is followed by a 1 or 2; a 1 is followed by a 3, 4, or 5; a 2 is followed by a 6, 7, or 8; a 3 is followed by a 0, 1, or 9; a 4 is followed by a 2 or 3; a 5 is followed by a 6 or 7; a 6 is followed by a 0, 8, or 9; a 7 is followed by a 1, 2, or 3; an 8 is followed by a 4, 5, or 6; and a 9 is followed by a 7 or 8. (These observations assume the number has at least two digits.)",

        "The number 0 has been included here for two reasons: (i) we may assume that it satisfies the conditions of the problem vacuously, and (ii) its inclusion allows Schuh to solve the \"treble puzzle\". The numbers in A023087 are all permutations of combinations of numbers in this sequence."
