        "Consider a two-player stone-throwing game with a single shared pile of stones. The players alternately remove one or more stones from the pile until it is empty. In addition, each player seeks to communicate a message through their sequence of moves. If there are initially n stones then a(n) is the largest number m such that both players can communicate at least m distinct messages.",
        "For n > 0, a(n) is also the size of the Durfee square of the partition defined in A064660."
