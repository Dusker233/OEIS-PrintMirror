        "This sequence is similar to Fibonacci sequence except that, if a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) is not a prime, the prime numbers < a(n-2) are added to a(n-1)+a(n-2) sequentially starting from the largest prime number < a(n-2) until the sum becomes a prime.",
        "If the prime numbers added to a(n-1)+a(n-2) are limited to the terms < a(n-2) that are already in the sequence including a(0)=1, we would have a new sequence with 9 terms only: 2, 3, 5, 11, 19, 41, 71, 131, 281.",
        "When a(n-1)+a(n-2) is not prime, the last digit of the last term, prime(s), added to a(n-1)+a(n-2) is either \"1\", \"7\", or \"9\" for n up to 35, except prime(s) = 3 for n = 5 and prime(s) = 23 for n=8. This trend has yet to be verified for n > 35.",
        "Although a(0)=1 is an anchor for the sequence, a(0) does not appear in the sequence because the obvious intent is to construct a sequence of primes. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 18 2021"
