        "This sequence is a proper subsequence of A257591 where also odd numbers, not a prime power, and  1 (mod 4) divisors involving only primes congruent to 3 modulo 4 are included, like  63, 99, 147, 171, 189, ... .",
        "This sequence gives all odd moduli m that have solutions of the complex congruence z^2 = +1 (mod m), with z = a + b*i, where a, b are positive integers (nonvanishing a*b case). For a proof one can use the formula for the number of solutions of this congruence for a*b vanishing, given in A329586 without powers of 2 (e2 = 0) and subtract it from the formula for the number of all representative solutions with modulus m >= 1 which is S(m) = 1 if m = 1, and S(m) = 2^(2*r1(m) + r3(m)), with r1(m) and r3(m) the number of distinct primes 1 (mod 4) (A002144) and 3 (mod 4) (A002145), respectively. This becomes the number of representative solutions  2^(r1(m) + r3(m))*(2^(r1(m)) - 1) - delta(r3(m), 0)*2^(r1(m))), with the Kronecker symbol. This shows that for odd modulus m >= 3 and nonvanishing a*b there is no solution if r1(m) = 0 and r3 >= 1. Moduli which are powers of a single prime have only solutions with a or b vanishing.",
