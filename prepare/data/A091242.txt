        "\"Coded in binary\" means that a polynomial a(n)*X^n+...+a(0)*X^0 over GF(2) is represented by the binary number a(n)*2^n+...+a(0)*2^0 in Z (where a(k)=0 or 1). - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 18 2014",
        "The reducible polynomials in GF(2)[X] are the analog to the composite numbers A002808 in the integers.",
        "It follows that the sequence is closed under application of A048720(.,.), which effects multiplication of the coded polynomials. It is also closed under application of blue code, A193231. The majority of the terms are coded multiples of X^1 (represented by 2) and/or X^1+1 (represented by 3): see A005843 and A001969 respectively. A246157 lists the other terms. - _Peter Munn_, Apr 20 2021"
