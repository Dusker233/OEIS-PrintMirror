    "comment": [
        "An integer matrix is unimodular if its determinant is -1 or +1. Two matrices are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by permuting rows and columns."

    "example": [
        "For n=1, the only example is [1]. For n=2, representatives of the equivalence classes are [[1,0],[0,1]] and [[1,1],[0,1]]."
