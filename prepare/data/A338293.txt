The Jacobsthal products formula gives log(c(n)) = log(2)/2^n + log(J(n+1))/2^n + Sum_{k=1..n} log(J(k))/2^k.  Then discarding log(J(1)) = log(J(2)) = 0, and log(2)/2^n -> 0, and log(J(n+1))/2^n -> 0, leaves the terms of A242049 so that log(C) = A242049.",
        "The asymptotic factor F = 1/2 is found by letting f(n) = a(n)/a(n-1)^2, so f(n) = J(n+1) / J(n) by the products formula, and f(n) = 2 + (-1)^n/J(n) -> 2 = 1/F.  This factor makes no difference to the growth power C, since any F^(1/2^n) -> 1, but it brings the approximation closer to a(n) sooner."
