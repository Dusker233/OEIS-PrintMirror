        "Among terms n=1..7, each number iterates through the previous terms. For example, the first iteration takes 1682 to 632=a(6), the second takes 632 to 49=a(5) and so forth.",
        "1682 is the only number < 10^6 that requires 7 iterations to reach completion.",
        "a(8), if it exists, is larger than 10^6."

    "example": [
        "a(7) = 1682 because the first number to require 7 iterations to reach 2 or less is 1682.",
        "Each iteration step is n <- 2n - {sum of proper factors of 2n} = A157449(2n); for n = 1682, this gives 2n = 3364, 3364 - (2 + 4 + 29 + 58 + 116 + 841 + 1682) = 632, which is a(6).",
        "Note that the proper factors of x are all divisors of x other than 1 and x."
