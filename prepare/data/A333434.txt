        "The diagonal-edged checker board of width and height 2*n-1 contains 8*n-4 vertices lying on a 2D square grid as shown in the examples below. Join every pair of vertices by a line segment, provided the line does not extend beyond the boundary of the board. The sequence gives the number of regions in the resulting figure."
