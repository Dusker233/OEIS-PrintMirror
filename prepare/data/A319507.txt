        "To compute the \"multiplicative-additive divisors persistence\" of a number, we proceed as follows. Form the product of the digits of the number (A007954) divided by the sum of the digits (A007953). Repeat this process until you reach 0 or 1. If we reach a non-integer, we write 0. The \"multiplicative-additive divisors persistence\" is the number of steps to reach 0 or 1.",
        "For instance: the multiplicative-additive divisors persistence of 874 is 1, because 874 -> 8 * 7 * 4 / (8 + 7 + 4) = 224/19. This is not an integer, so the process stops after one step."
