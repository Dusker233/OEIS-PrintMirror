        "Using the formulae in C. G. Bower's web link below about transforms, it can be proved that, for k >= 2, the BHK[k] transform of sequence (c(n): n >= 1), which has g.f. C(x) = Sum_{n >= 1} c(n)*x^n, has generating function B_k(x) = (1/2)*(C(x)^k - C(x^2)^{k/2}) if k is even, and B_k(x) = C(x)*B_{k-1}(x) = (C(x)/2)*(C(x)^{k-1} - C(x^2)^{(k-1)/2}) if k is odd. For k=1, Bower assumes that the BHK[k=1] transform of (c(n): n >= 1) is itself, which means that the g.f. of the output sequence is C(x). (This assumption is not accepted by all mathematicians because a sequence of length 1 is not only reversible but palindromic as well.)",
        "Since a(m) = BHK(c(n): n >= 1)(m) = Sum_{k=1..m} BHK[k](c(n): n >= 1)(m) for m = 1,2,3,..., it can be easily proved (using sums of infinite geometric series) that the g.f. of BHK(c(n): n >= 1) is A(x) = (C(x)^2 - C(x^2))/(2*(1-C(x))*(1-C(x^2))) + C(x). (The extra C(x) is due of course to the special assumption made for the BHK[k=1] transform.)",
        "Here, BHK(c(n): n >= 1)(m) indicates the m-th element of the output sequence when the transform is BHK and the input sequence is (c(n): n >= 1). Similarly, BHK[k](c(n): n >= 1)(m) indicates the m-th element of the output sequence when the transform is BHK[k] (i.e., with k boxes) and the input sequence is (c(n): n >= 1).",
        "For the current sequence, c(1) = 4, and c(n) = 0 for all n >= 2, and thus, C(x) = 4x. Substituting into the above formula for A(x), and doing the algebra, we get A(x) = 2*x*(2-5*x-8*x^2+32*x^3) / ((2*x+1)*(2*x-1)*(4*x-1)), which is _R. J. Mathar_'s formula below.",
