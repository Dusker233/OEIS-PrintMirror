Of the 6 permutations of these words, the a(3) = 2 permutations 1,10,11 and 11,10,1 are unambiguous when the commas are removed, since 11011 and 11101 each arise from a unique permutation. On the other hand, the permutations 1,11,10 and 11,1,10 are ambiguous when the commas are removed because they become the same word; similarly, 10,1,11 and 10,11,1 become the same word."
