Similarly to A067251, A209931 includes 91-99 as terms whereas they are not in this sequence. A043095(1)=0 and A023804(1)=0 whereas 0 is not a term in this sequence (there are additional differences, such as the term that comes after 89 in A023804 and A043095 being 99).",

However if you choose 8 as a seed and 0 as the sought difference, you'll get no terms."
