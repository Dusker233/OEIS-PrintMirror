        "Using the Artin-Wedderburn theorem, a finite semisimple ring is a product of matrix algebras over finite field. In particular, if n is squarefree then any semisimple ring of cardinal n is commutative. One can be more precise, indeed all semisimple rings with n elements are commutative if and only if the only 4th power that divides n is 1.",

        "For n=4, we have two possible rings: F_4 and F_2 X F_2. We use the notation F_q to denote the finite field with q elements. To compute a(4) we need to know how many ring automorphisms F_4 and F_2 X F_2 admit. For F_4, we have that Aut(F_4) is generated by the Frobenius morphism, hence we have 2 automorphisms. For F_2 X F_2, the only nontrivial automorphism is exchanging the two coordinates, hence we also have 2 automorphisms. Hence:",
