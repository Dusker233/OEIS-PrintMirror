        "Numbers of the form F(k) - 1 have the same Zeckendorf (A014417) and dual Zeckendorf (A104326) representations: alternating digits of 1 and 0 whose sum is floor((k - 1)/2). Thus, if k is in this sequence then F(k) - 1 is both a Zeckendorf-Niven number (A328208) and a lazy-Fibonacci-Niven number (A328212), i.e., A000071(a(n)) is in A330711."
