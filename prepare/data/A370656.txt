    "name": "Number of cross-equivalence classes of the symmetric group S_n, where two permutations are cross-equivalent if the multiset of forward distances for every element i in the permutation, for 1 <= i <= n-1, up to and including n, is the same.",
    "comment": [
        "The equivalence classes are defined based on a problem described on page 10 of the paper \"On super-strong Wilf equivalence classes of permutations\" by Ioannis Michos, Christina Savvidou, and Demetris Hadjiloucas, The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 25 (2) (2018). For each permutation of n elements, distances are calculated as the absolute difference in positions for each pair of elements. For each element in a permutation of S_n, that is less than or equal to n-1, one calculates the absolute difference with every other element that comes after it. Permutations are then grouped into equivalence classes when their multisets of distances match. The sequence was generated using a Python as well as a C++ program. The program enumerates all permutations of n elements and classifies them into these equivalence classes."
