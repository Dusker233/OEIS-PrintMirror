        "Each chiral pair is counted as two when enumerating oriented arrangements. The Schl\u00e4fli symbols for the tesseract and the hyperoctahedron are {4,3,3} and {3,3,4} respectively. Both figures are regular 4-D polyhedra and they are mutually dual. There are 192 elements in the rotation group of the tesseract. Each involves a permutation of the axes that can be associated with a partition of 4 based on the conjugacy class of the permutation. This table shows the cycle indices for each rotation by partition. The first formula is obtained by averaging these cycle indices after replacing x_i^j with n^j according to the P\u00f3lya enumeration theorem.",
