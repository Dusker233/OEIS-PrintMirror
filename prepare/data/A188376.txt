        "CLAIM: d equals the Pell word A171588 on the alphabet {3,1}, i.e., d is the unique fixed point of the morphism 3->331, 1->3.",

The differences between the occurrences of 1's are therefore equal to 3, 3, or 1, and moreover, these differences occur exactly as the sequence of beta(1)'s, beta(2)'s and beta(3)'s. After projecting 1->3, 2->3, 3->1 this yields the morphism 3->331, 1->3.",
