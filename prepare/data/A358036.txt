    "comment": [
        "Consider a self-avoiding walk on a 2D square lattice where two visited lattice points are considered to be visible from each other if, on drawing a line directly between these two points, the line neither crosses another lattice point which has been visited by previous steps of the walk, nor crosses any line directly connecting two consecutively visited lattice points that forms a part of the path of the walk. This sequence lists the number of n-step self-avoiding walks for which the first visited lattice point of the walk is directly visible from the last visited point. See the examples below.",
        "For the 29-step walk the ratio of the number of end-to-end visible walks to all walks is a(29)/A001411(29) = 1730939615552/6279396229332 ~ 0.276. The value and behavior of this ratio as n -> infinity is unknown.",
