        "The primitive nondeficient number list (A006039) abbreviates the nondeficient number list (A023196) by omitting multiples of numbers that have already appeared. Here we abbreviate further, although typically by omission due to the lesser abundancy of a larger number. For instance, 315 * p is a primitive nondeficient number for prime p, 3 <= p <= 103; of these only 32445 = 315 * 103 is listed. See the example section for further detail."

        "6 is a perfect number, and a perfect number is a primitive nondeficient number with the least abundancy (1.0) for classification as nondeficient, from which we see there is no nondeficient k with lesser abundancy. So 6 meets the stronger condition to be listed here.",
        "12 is nondeficient, but is not primitive (as a multiple of nondeficient 6). So 12 is not listed.",
        "104 = 2^3*13 is nondeficient, but 52 & 8 (and so other proper divisors) are deficient. So 104 is primitive nondeficient. To evaluate the stronger condition, we replace a factor 2 by prime p_1 <> 2, giving k = 2^2 * 13 * p_1 (maybe k = 2^2 * 13^2), or the factor 13 by prime p_2 <> 13, giving k = 2^3 * p_2 (maybe k = 2^4). If p_1 > 11, p_2 = 2, or p_2 > 13, k is deficient. Otherwise (p_1 <= 11 or 2 < p_2 < 13, and) calculation shows abundancy of k is greater than the abundancy of 104. So there is no nondeficient k with lesser abundancy. So 104 is listed.",

        "88 = 2^3*11 is nondeficient, but is not listed because 104 = 2^3*13 is nondeficient and 13 contributes a smaller factor to abundancy (14/13) than 11 does (12/11). Likewise, 272, 304, 368, 464 (each 16 times a prime) are omitted due to the lesser abundancy of 496 = 16*31 (which is listed).",
        "70 is nondeficient, but is not listed due to the lesser abundancy of nondeficient 28. 70 = 2*7*5, whereas 28 = 2*7*2, and a second factor of 2 contributes a smaller factor to abundancy (7/6) than the first factor of 5 does (6/5).",
