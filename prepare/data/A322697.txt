        "The terms are consecutive 11-tuples, ordered so that (A) a(11i-10) < a(11i-9) < ... < a(11i) for i > 0, and (B) a(11i+1) < a(11i+12) for i >= 0.  This sequence has primitive solutions only.  If k is relatively prime to all of the terms in a primitive 11-tuple, then multiplying the terms in that 11-tuple by k gives another solution - see A322687."
