        "An integer partition has sortable prime factors if there is a permutation (c_1,...,c_k) of the parts such that the maximum prime factor of c_i is at most the minimum prime factor of c_{i+1}. For example, the partition (27,8,6) is sortable because the permutation (8,6,27) satisfies the condition."
