        "This is the sequence where fractions of repunits (A002275) and their number of digits in base 10 R(k) / k are integers, where k is A014950(n). This happens for all k of the form k=3^m; this is true because R(3k) / R(k) = 10^(2k) + 10^n*k + 1, which is divisible by 3. Therefore R(3^m) is divisible by 3^m by induction on m. There are additional solutions in A014950."
