        "In Minecraft worlds, a source block of water can be reacted with another source block, two blocks away, linearly or diagonally. This reaction creates a third \"infinite\" source block in the unoccupied intermediate block or blocks, so called because if the intermediate water source is destroyed or picked up by a player using a bucket, it will immediately regenerate itself.",
        "A placement of water at several positions in an n X n board is said to be static if no infinite water sources are created that are not already present. In particular, the total quantity of water in the system is held constant."
