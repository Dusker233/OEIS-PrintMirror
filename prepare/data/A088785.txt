        "Imagine that each digit of a prime is on a wheel on a combination lock and each wheel is being rotated two notches. Thus for the digits 0 to 7, the replacement digit is simply the digit+2, but for 8 the replacement digit is 0 and for 9 the replacement digit is 1. Thus 227 --> 449 --> 661 --> 883 --> 5 (initial 0's are dropped on results)."
