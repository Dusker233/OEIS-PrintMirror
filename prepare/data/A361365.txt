    "comment": [
        "Imagine a safe combination lock that has two independently rotating concentric number dials. The simplest model has just n = 1 number on each of its dials and one alignment position for those two numbers on them, allowing a single possible setting. But on the more advanced models there are n = 2, n = 3, and so on equally spaced numbers for each dial. All the numbers are different on a model, and when its dials are set in any combination, then every two numbers aligned will add up to a prime number. Necessarily, the numbers on one dial are all odd and on the other all even.",
        "More than one set may correspond to some a(n), as is the case of a(4).",
        "Any set corresponding to the n-th term is a partition of the term with 2*n distinct parts.",
        "The procedure described in A162662 may aid the construction of candidate sets here, though their sums seem much greater than the minimum."
