        "Differs from A213215 in that repeated values are removed, i.e., if a gap in the number of consecutive tripling steps occurs, A213215 will report the starting value multiple times but this sequence will not. Example: The Collatz sequence for 15 has 4 tripling steps but the sequence for 27 has 6, so 27 is reported by A213215 for n=5 and n=6. This sequence only reports 27 once as having set a new record.",
        "Differs from A222598 in that certain consecutive tripling step lengths will not be represented here when a gap in the record number of consecutive tripling steps occurs. Example: Since the consecutive tripling step record moves from 4 in the Collatz sequence for 15 to 6 in the Collatz sequence for 27, this sequence will not report the Collatz sequence for 159 with 5 consecutive tripling steps like A222598 does."
