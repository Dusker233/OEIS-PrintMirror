        "To determine whether a given number k is a term of this sequence, start with k, take the cube of the product of its nonzero digits, apply the same process to the result, and continue until 30 iterations are reached. If 1 is reached during the process, k is a term of this sequence. If not, k is not a term of this sequence.",
