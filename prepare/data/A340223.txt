    "comment": [
        "The Artin-Wedderburn theorem states that every finite-dimensional semisimple algebra A over a field K can be uniquely (up to the permutation of direct factors) written as A = M_(m_1)(D_1) X M_(m_2)(D_2) X ... X M_(m_n)(D_n), where D_i is a division algebra over K, M_m(D) is the algebra of m X m matrices over D. Here each D_i is necessarily associative since semisimple algebras are defined to be so. By the Frobenius theorem, the only finite-dimensional associative division algebras over the reals are isomorphic to R (the real numbers), C (the complex numbers) or H (the quaternions). (Note that there are other non-associative division algebras over R, the octonions, for example.) As a consequence, every finite-dimensional semisimple algebra over R is built up by M_k(R) (dimension k^2), M_k(C) (dimension 2*k^2) and M_k(H) (dimension 4*k^2).",
        "Also, since the complex numbers C is an algebraically closed field, the only finite-dimensional associative division algebras over C is C itself, so every finite-dimensional semisimple algebra A over C must have C = M_(m_1)(C) X M_(m_2)(C) X ... X M_(m_n)(C). Hence the number of n-dimensional semisimple algebras over C is given by A001156."
