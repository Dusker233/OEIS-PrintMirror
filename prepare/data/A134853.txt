There is only one largest digit which represents the top of the mountain. This sequence is finite. The last member is 123456789876543210.",
        "The sequence is a supersequence of A134941, because the restriction that both feet of the mountain are at \"sea level\" (first and last digit equal 1) is dropped here.",
