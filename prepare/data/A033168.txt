        "Since 210 == 1 (mod 11), a progression of primes with difference 210 can't have more than ten terms because there is exactly one multiple of 11 within each run of eleven consecutive terms. For example, 2089 + 210 = 2299 = 11^2 * 19. - _Alonso del Arte_, Dec 22 2017, edited by _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 02 2020",
        "After 199, the next prime which starts a CPAP-10 with common gap 210 is 243051733. See A094220 for further starting points. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 02 2020"
