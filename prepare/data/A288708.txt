        "Proof of this conjecture. One follows the same strategy as in the proof of the conjecture in A288709. We have a(n)/n -> -1 + sqrt(5) if and only if n/a(n) -> (1+sqrt(5))/4, which is the frequency of 0's in A288707. If alpha = (3-sqrt(5))/2 is the frequency of 1's in y = A189661 = 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ... then (2*(1-alpha)+alpha)/2 is the frequency of 0's in A288707, since every 0 in y produces 2 zeros in A288707, and every 1 just 1 zero (and one 1). One computes (2*(1-alpha)+alpha)/2 = (1+sqrt(5))/4. The bounds follow from the exponential convergence of the frequencies of 0 and 1 in y. - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 19 2018"
