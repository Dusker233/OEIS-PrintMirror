        "Only cycles of length greater than 2 are here. Cycles of length 1 correspond to infinitary perfect numbers (A007357), and cycles of length 2 correspond to infinitary amicable pairs (A126169 and A126170).",
        "The corresponding cycles are of lengths 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 11, 6, 4, 6, 4, 11, 6, 23, 4, 4, 85, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, ...",
        "It is conjectured that there are no missing terms in the data, but it was not proven. For example, it is not known that the infinitary aliquot sequence that starts at 840 does not reach 840 again (see A361421). (End)"
