        "A quantale is an algebraic structure (X,*,v) composed of a set X of elements, a semigroup operator \"*\" and a supremum operator \"v\" (in the sense of lattices) such that * distributes over v: x * (y v z) = (x * y) v (x * z) and (x v y) * z = (x * z) v (y * z) for all elements x,y,z in X. In addition the bottom element corresponding to v, denoted 0, must satisfy x * 0 = 0 * x = 0."
