        "For D=29, the least positive y for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 3. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 41, but the smallest positive y in this case is 1, which is less than the previous record y, 3. So, 41 is not a term.",
        "The next prime, D, after 41 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 61 and the least positive y for which it has a solution is y=21, which is larger than 3, so it is a new record y value. So 61 is a term of A341085 and 21 is a term of this sequence."
