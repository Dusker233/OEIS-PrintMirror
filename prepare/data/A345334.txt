    "comment": [
        "It seems that the fraction of prime gap pairs (g1, g2) for which g1 == 0 (mod 6), satisfying g2 == 4 (mod 6), i.e., a(n)/A340948(n), tends to a constant, say c, when the number of prime gaps tends to infinity. From n = 27 we obtain that c < 0.284, while it can be argued heuristically that c > 0.25.",
