Similarly, from the fact that all strings derived from S_d have prefix 11 and suffix 000, it can be proved that all strings derived from S_c must have prefix 111 (i.e., again, 1 is prefix of s, with s as in the name of this sequence). In the later case, 11 is a prefix of s, which is even stronger. I believe additional stronger conditions can be observed and proved, so I challenge others to take a look at it too."
