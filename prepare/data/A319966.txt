        "By analogy with the Wythoff compound sequences A003622 etc., the nine compounds of A003144, A003145, A003146 might be called the tribonacci compound sequences. They are A278040, A278041, and A319966-A319972.",
        "This sequence gives the positions of the word aa in the tribonacci word t = abacabaa..., fixed point of the morphism a->ab, b->ac, c->a.  This follows from the fact that the positional sequences of aa, ab and ac give a splitting of the positional sequence of the letter a, and the three sets AA(N), AB(N) and AC(N), give a splitting of the set A(N). Here A := A003144, B := A003145, C := A003146, and N is the set of positive integers. - _Michel Dekking_, Apr 09 2019"
