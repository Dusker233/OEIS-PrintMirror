        "A border of a string w is a nonempty proper prefix of w that is also a suffix.  The LB (\"longest border\") factorization of a string w is as follows:  if w has no border, then the factorization is just (w).  Otherwise, write w = (x)(w')(x) where x is the longest border of length <= |w|/2, and continue with w'.   The length of the factorization is the number of factors.  For example, 0101101010 = (010)(1)(10)(1)(010), and so has length 5."
