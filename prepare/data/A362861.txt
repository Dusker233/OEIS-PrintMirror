        "If a(15) exists, it should be greater than 10290.",

        "(ii) Each positive even number can be written as a sum of distinct elements of the set {3^a + 7^b: a,b = 0,1,2,...}. Also, any positive even number not equal to 12 can be written as a sum of numbers of the form 3^a + 5^b (a,b >= 0) with no summand dividing another.",
        "Conjecture 2: Let k and m be positive odd numbers greater than one. Then, any sufficiently large even numbers can be written as a sum of distinct elements of the set {k^a + m^b: a,b = 0,1,2,...}.",
