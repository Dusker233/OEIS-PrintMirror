        "G. B. Mathews (\"Theory of Numbers\" by Chelsea publishing) might have an answer to the relation with A038987. In point 59 on page 65 he claims that",

        "- if X is a residue of D, then there is a quadratic form of determinant D which represents X.",
        "If all forms of discriminant 97 are equivalent, then that might suffice. (Indeed, either +97 or -97 has class number 1; but I am not sure which sign matters, A003656 vs. A003173.)",

        "Also primes of the form u^2 + u*v - 24*v^2. Substitute u, v by u = 9*x+22*y, v = 2*x+5*y gives 3*x^2 + 5*x*y - 6*y^2.",
        "Yes, this is the same as A038987. For primes p being a (coprime) square modulo 97, they split in the ring Z[(1+sqrt(97))/2]. Since Z[(1+sqrt(97))/2] is a UFD, they are reducible in Z[(1+sqrt(97))/2], so we have p = e*(u + v*(1+sqrt(97))/2)*(u + v*(1-sqrt(97))/2) = e*(u^2 + u*v - 24*v^2), e = +-1. WLOG we can suppose e = 1, otherwise substitute u, v by 5035*u+27312*v and 1138*u+6173*v, then p = u^2 + u*v - 24*v^2. On the other hand, if p is a quadratic nonresidue modulo 97, then they remain inert in Z[(1+sqrt(97))/2] and hence cannot be represented as u^2 + u*v - 24*v^2. (End)"
