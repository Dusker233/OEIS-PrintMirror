        "This sequence is a generalization of A323295 to the 3D case. Usually, in multidimensional data related applications (i.e., images, MRI), data is vectorized and then processed. However, because of vectorization, the spatial information in the data is lost. This reverse mapping shows the possible number of spatial states the original data could have been in."
