        "The first three terms (indices 0, 1 and 2) are the only known primes. Moreover, the terms not of the form a(2^k) are all composite, except for a(0). Indeed, for all n >= 0, a(2n+1) is divisible by 11, a(4n+2) is divisible by 101, a(8n+4) is divisible by 73, a(16n+8) is divisible by 17, a(32n+16) is divisible by 353, a(64n+32) is divisible by 19841, etc. - _M.
