        "Related to the \"Twin Fortune Conjecture\" (A. Dinculescu) which states that the distance between p#/6 and the next larger or smaller n in A002822 (twin rank, such that 6n +- 1 are twin primes) is again a twin rank; very similar to Fortune's Conjecture, cf. A005235.",
        "For a(1) = 41, the non twin rank is p#/6 - n, for all other terms listed here, it is m - p#/6. However, in these cases, the other distance is a twin rank. For all other primes, both distances are twin ranks."
