        "The usual tribonacci representation of n writes n as a sum of tribonacci numbers 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ... (A000073) avoiding using three consecutive numbers (see A003726, A278038). But if we are not allowed to use 1, then not all numbers can be represented, and such numbers are listed here. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 08 2018",
