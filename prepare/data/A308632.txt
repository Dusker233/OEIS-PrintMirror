        "Sequence A250000 is the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens can coexist on an n X n chessboard without attacking each other. However, one of the players can have more than m queens, being a bigger 'aggressor' in peaceful times. The current sequence lists the largest aggressors with k queens when the opponent has m queens for an n X n chessboard (from A250000).",
        "The idea and name of the sequence was first mentioned by _Bob Selcoe_ on May 29 2019 in the comment section of A250000.",
        "The sequence was initially generated by _Roy van Rijn_ using a SAT solver and is optimal for n=1 to n=11 (as of June 12 2019).",
        "_Bob Selcoe_ has shown it is possible to construct a 15 X 15 board with 32 queens of one color and 34 of another but this hasn't yet been proved to be optimal.",
        "Many of these values have already been obtained by Stephen Ainley in 1977 (see links).",
