        "First differences are 4 and 5. Also, there is no immediate pattern in parity of a(n).",
        "Are similar sequences well defined (in terms of rounding problems)? See also A086843, A086844, A196468.",
        "Answer: I would not call the sequences A086843, A086844, A196468 'similar' to (a(n)). The first differences d =5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,4,... are a Sturmian sequence (d(n)) with slope alpha = 2 + sqrt(8) and intercept 0. We give d offset 0 by setting d(0):=4. By Hofstadter's Fundamental Theorem of eta-sequences, the chunks 45555 and 455555 occur following a Sturmian sequence with density beta = (sqrt(8) - 2)/(3 - sqrt(8)). Since beta = 2 + sqrt(8) = alpha, the sequence (d(n)) is fixed point of the substitution 4->45555, 5->455555. See A197879 for a complete description of the parity pattern of (a(n)). - _Michel Dekking_, Jan 24 2017"
