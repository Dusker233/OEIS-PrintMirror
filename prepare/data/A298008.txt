The second term has the number of prime numbers between 10 and 19 (4) and since it was counted in the range between 10 and 19 it represents this range with the one in the first digit in the left: 14. The third element is 22 as there are 2 primes between 20 and 29. And so on. Larger element: there is only one prime between 120 and 129, hence a(13)=121."
