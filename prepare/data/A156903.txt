        "Seems to be a proper subset of A083211. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Mar 30 2010. This sequence is indeed a proper subset of A083211, since the abundance of a number k, A033880(k) = sigma(k) - 2*k, has the same parity as sigma(k). If sigma(k) is odd then the sums of any two complementary subsets of the divisors of k have different parities and thus they cannot be equal. - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 20 2020",

        "If n is in the sequence, so is 100*n (conjectured). - _Sergey Pavlov_, Mar 22 2017. Pavlov's observation trivially follows from the fact that to have odd abundance a number k must be either a square or twice a square. If such a number k is abundant then 100*k = (10^2) * k is abundant as well and has odd abundance. In general, we can say that if k is present, so are t^2*k and 2*t^2*k, for every t>0. - _Giovanni Resta_, Oct 16 2018",
