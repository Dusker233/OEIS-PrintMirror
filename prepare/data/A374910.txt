    "comment": [
        "The two-player impartial {0,1}-Toggle game is played on a simple connected graph G where each vertex is assigned an initial weight of 0 or 1.",
        "A Toggle move consists of selecting a vertex v and switching its weight as well as the weight of each of its neighbors. This move is only legal provided the weight of vertex v is 1 and the total sum of the vertex weights decreases.",
        "In the special case G=P(k+4), a (1^k,0,1,0,1)-weight assignment is one in which vertices v(k+1) and v(k+3) are assigned weight 0 and all remaining vertices are assigned weight 1.",
        "The path P(k+4m) where vertices v(k+1), v(k+3), ..., v(k+4m-1) are assigned weight 0 and all remaining vertices are assigned weight 1 will have the same Grundy numbers as G.",
