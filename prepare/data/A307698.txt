    "comment": [
        "An evolutionary history of size n is an ordered rooted (incomplete) binary tree with n leaves describing the evolution of a gene family of a species in phylogenomics. The caterpillar species tree S of size k is a binary tree with k leaves, where any left child is a leaf. Any node of the history is associated to a unique node of S, where specifically every leaf is associated to a leaf of S. A history is created by the following process (note that intermediate trees in this process may not be valid histories): Start with a root node associated to the root of S. For a given tree in the growth process, choose a leaf and perform a duplication, speciation, or (speciation-)loss event. A duplication event creates two children both associated to the same node as its parent. A speciation or (speciation-)loss event can only occur if the node is associated to an internal node in S. In that case, a speciation event creates two children associated to the children of the node in S. A (speciation-)loss event creates only a left or right child, associated to the left or right child in S, respectively."
