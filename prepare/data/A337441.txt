    "comment": [
        "Consider a self-avoiding walk composed of three different types of repeating units which cannot be adjacent to a unit of the same type. This sequence gives the total number of such n-step walks on the square lattice. Note that the walk will only differ from the standard self-avoiding walk of A001411 if the number of different repeating units is an odd number; in a chain composed of an even number the same unit types will never be adjacent and thus their mutual repulsion will have no effect."
