        "On 06 January 2012, Daniel C. Mayer determined the abelian type invariants (ATI), and thus indirectly the coarse capitulation type, of the eight unramified cyclic septic extensions for all 70 discriminants in the range between -63499 and -751288. On page 133 of his 2012 Ph.D. thesis, Tobias Bembom independently recomputed the capitulation for the two discriminants -63499 and -159592. In the time between 09 and 16 August 2014, Daniel C. Mayer computed the fine capitulation type of all 94 discriminants in the range -63499 and -991720 without any hit of the identity capitulation. Since the fine capitulation requires much more CPU time than the ATI, Mayer conducted an extensive search for the identity capitulation, identified by eight ATI of the shape (7,7,7), in the range from 10^6 to 6578723, with an eventual successful hit of the identity capitulation for -5073691 (the 555th term of A359872) on 26 October 2019 (see A359296)."
