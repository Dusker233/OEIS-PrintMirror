        "4n - a(n) is in {0,1,3} for n >= 1.  The first 20 numbers 4n - a(n) are 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3.  In the sequence (4n - a(n)), let r be the sequence of positions occupied by 3; and likewise, s for 0 and t for 1; then r = A287373, s = A287374, and t = A287375.",

        "Proof of these conjectures:  Let b(n):=4n-a(n). Note first that a simple way to express the r,s,t property above is to say that the sequence b is obtained from the sequence x := A101666 = 0,1,1,2,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,..., by changing the alphabet from {0,1,2} to {3,0,1}.",

        "Since sigma^2(x) = x, we immediately see from this that the 0's occur in x at positions 0, 1 and 3 modulo 4.",
