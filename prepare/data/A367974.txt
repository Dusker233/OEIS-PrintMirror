        "Overlapping of the \"Look and Say\" prime factor description strings is allowed. It is likely, although unproven, that 25 = 5*5 = \"two 5's\" = \"25\" is the only number that \"perfectly\" describes its own \"Look and Say\" factorization, i.e., there are no overlapping factor description strings, and all digits of the number are used in the factor description strings. It is unknown if the sequence is infinite."
