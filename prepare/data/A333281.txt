        "For the graphs defined in A331452 and A288187 only the counts for graphs that are one square wide have formulas for regions, edges, and vertices (see A306302, A331757, A331755). For width 2 there are six such sequences (A331766, A331765, A331763; A333279, A333280, A333281). It would be nice to have a formula for any one of them.",
