        "Any of these integers can be expressed by a composition of floor functions f(n) = [mu*n] and g(n) = [nu*n], provided that the composition applies at least one f(n) and one g(n), for an irrational slope 1 < mu < 2 and its conjugate nu = 1/(1-1/mu). This follows from the Rayleigh-Beatty theorem. See reference in link. A064801 gives \"floor squares.\""

    "example": [
        "Example (of calculation by sieve, see reference in link, p. 221): The first term, 2, while given by the (un-nested) floor [mu] of a real slope 2 <= mu < 3, is too big to result from a twice-nested floor [[mu]mu], thrice-nested floor [mu[mu[mu]]], etc. for mu < 2. Yet for mu >= 2, the integer 2 is too small to result from a twice-nested, thrice-nested, etc. floor. Sequence A064801 = 1,4,5,9,... gives the \"floor squares\" - positive integers that are expressible as the twice-nested floor [mu[mu]] for a positive real slope mu. Thus 2,3,6,7 and 8 are not \"floor squares\". Besides 0 and 1, the next smallest integer obtainable from nesting a floor function with real positive slope t times is 2^t. Thus, the sequence of positive \"floor cubes\" starts with 1 and continues 8,9,12,13,14,27,... Hence, the first level of the sieve catches the floor squares 1,4,5,9,..., the second level of the sieve catches the floor cubes 1,8,... So, 2,3,6, and 7 are the initial floor-powerfree numbers passing the sieve for all t >= 2."
