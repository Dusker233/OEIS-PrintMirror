        "This sequence and the Busy Beaver (A028444) problem are closely related. Turing machines and the number of steps taken by a Turing machine on an initially blank tape are defined in A028444.",

        "a(n) - 1 <= (4n+1)^(2n), the number of n-state Turing machines with 2 symbols, by the pigeonhole principle. (4n+1)^(2n) is nearly A141475 (slightly different formalisms are used)."
