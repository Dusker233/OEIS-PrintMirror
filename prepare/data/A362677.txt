        "From _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jul 03 2023: (Start)",
        "Equivalently, primes whose reversal is one less than the cube of a positive integer whose last digit is not a 1.",
        "Since no prime starts or ends with a 0, reversing the prime will not change the number of digits, and since no prime consists only of 9's, adding 1 to its reversal will not change the number of digits, either, so the cube will have the same number of digits as the prime. Since the prime cannot begin with a 0, its reversal cannot end in 0, so the cube cannot end in 1 (and a cube ends in 1 if and only if its cube root ends in 1). Since cubes are less dense than primes, a reasonably efficient but simple way to search for all terms having at most D digits is to test each positive integer r < 10^(D/3) such that r mod 10 != 1: if the reversal of r^3 - 1 is a prime, then that prime is a term of the sequence.
