    "comment": [
        "The order given for P in the title is equivalent to the ordering: A <= B if and only if image(A) is contained in image(B) and null(A) contains null(B).  Then A is covered by B if and only if there is a 1-dimensional subspace U such that image(B) = image(A) direct sum U.  If such a subspace U exists then it is unique and is equal to the intersection of null(A) with image(B).  The number of maximal chains in P is A002884(n).  The set of all idempotent matrices over GF(q) with this ordering is a binomial poset with factorial function |GL_n(F_q)|/(q-1)^n. (see Stanley reference)."
