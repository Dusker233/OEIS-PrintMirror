        "The Hausdorff metric defines a distance between sets. Using this distance we can define line segments with sets as endpoints. Create two sets from the vertices of the parts A and B (with |A| = 3) of a complete bipartite graph K(3,n) (with n at least 3) missing two edges, where the removed edges are incident to the same point in A. Points in the sets A and B that correspond to vertices that are connected by edges are the same Euclidean distance apart. This sequence gives the number of sets at each location on the line segment between the sets A and B.",
