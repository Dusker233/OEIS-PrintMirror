    "comment": [
        "a(n) grows like log n. Proof: The set of powers of 2 in {1,2,3,...,n} cannot contain two (nonempty) disjoint subsets with the same sum due to binary representation being unique, hence 1+log_2(n) < a(n). Let N be the least integer such that Sum_{i=0..N-1} (n-i) < 2^N-1. Then by the pigeonhole principle, we have a(n) <= N because the range of possible sums (for nonempty subsets of an N-element set) is at most Sum_{i=0..N-1} (n-i) and there are 2^N-1 nonempty subsets in total. Also N is O(log n).",
        "Note that if we have two (distinct) subsets whose sums agree, then we can remove the integers in the intersection from both sets to get two disjoint (and nonempty) subsets with the same sum.",
        "Also note that a 0-, 1- or 2-element subset cannot have (nonempty) disjoint subsets with the same sum.",
