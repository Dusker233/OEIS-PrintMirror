        "Let g1 = q-p, g2 = r-q, g3 = s-r be the gaps between the consecutive primes p,q,r,s.  Then p*s = (q-g1)*(q+g2+g3) == -g1*(g2+g3) (mod q) and similarly p*s == -(g1+g2)*g3 (mod r).  According to Cramer's conjecture, g1*(g2+g3) < q and (g1+g2)*g3 < r for all but finitely many p: the only exception in this sequence appears to be p=3.  When g1*(g2+g3) < q and (g1+g2)*g3 < r we have ((p*s) mod r) - ((p*s) mod q) = (r - (g1+g2)*g3) - (q - g1*(g2+g3)) = g2*(g1-g3+1). This is 2 (allowing the possibility of twin primes) if g2 = 2 and g3 = g1."
