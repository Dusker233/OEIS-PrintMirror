    "name": "Number of edges in a polygon whose boundary consists of n+2 equally space points around a semicircle and n+2 equally spaced points along the diameter (a total of 2n+2 points). See Comments for precise definition.",
    "comment": [
        "A semi-circular polygon with 2n+2 points is created by placing n+2 equally spaced vertices along the semicircle's arc (including the two end vertices). Also place n+2 equally spaced vertices along the diameter (again including the same two end vertices). Now connect every pair of vertices by a straight line segment. The sequence gives the number of edges in the resulting figure."
