        "The first pair of consecutive integers that are both terms is (728, 729), and the first run of three consecutive integers all appearing as terms begins at 127251 (see Examples). The first run of four consecutive integers appearing as terms begins at 4405832. Do arbitrarily long runs of consecutive integers occur?"
