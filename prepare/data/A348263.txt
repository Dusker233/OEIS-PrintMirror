        "It appears that there is a mistake in the paragraph after Conjecture 7.2 of the Cain article. It claims that there are only 17 finite Parker fields, although Lemma 5.2 clearly shows that all fields of order 2^k are Parker. I think the corrected conjecture should state that there are only 16 finite Parker fields of odd order. - _Yevhenii Diomidov_, Jan 19 2022"
