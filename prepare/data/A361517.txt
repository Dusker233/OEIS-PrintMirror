        "The two-player impartial {0,1}-Toggle game is played on a simple connected graph G where each vertex is assigned an initial weight of 0 or 1.",
        "A Toggle move consists of selecting a vertex v and switching its weight as well as the weights of each of its neighbors. This move is only legal provided the weight of vertex v is 1 and the total sum of the vertex weights decreases.",
        "In the special case G=GP(n,2), a (1,0)-weight assignment is one in which each vertex of the outer polygon is assigned weight 1 and each vertex of the inner polygon(s) is assigned weight 0."
