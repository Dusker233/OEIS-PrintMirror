        "1. If n is not of the form 4^a * (8b + 7), then it follows from Legendre's three-square theorem that the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^8 = n has a solution with w = 0.",

        "(4) If a = 4k + 2 and w = 2j + 1, then n == 0 (mod 8), w^8 == 1 (mod 8), and n - w^8 is number of the form 8c + 7. I.e., the equation does not have a solution with w odd.",
        "If a = 4k + 2 and w = 4j + 2, then n - w^8 = 16 * (4^(4k) * (8b + 7) - 16 * (2j + 1)^8) = 4^4 * (4^(4k - 4) * (8b + 7) - (2j + 1)^8). When k = 0, n - w^8 is a number of the form 16 * (8c + 7); when k > 0, n - w^8 is a number of the form 4^4 * (8d + 7). Therefore, the equation does not have a solution with w = 4j + 2. Similarly, it can be proved that there is no solution with w = 4j."
