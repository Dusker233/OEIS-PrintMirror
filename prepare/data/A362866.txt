        "For the symmetric representation of sigma(n) to consist of 2 octagons the first 3 entries in row n of the triangle of A249223 must be nonzero, hence must be 1's, indicating width 1, with the remaining entries zero. Therefore, row n of A237048 is 100100..., implying n = 2*p with p>3 prime. Both conjectures are true. - _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Aug 22 2023"
