        "The sequence is a subsequence of A096170.",
        "Conjecture: the sequence consists of the numbers k such that tau(2k) = 4 and tau(2k-1) = 5. tau(82) = 4 and tau(81) = 5, 82/2 = 41 = a(1). tau(626) = 4 and tau(625) = 5, 626/2 = 313 = a(2). tau(2402) = 4 and tau(2401) = 5, 2402/2 = 1201 = a(3). The conjecture was checked for 10^9 consecutive integers.",
        "The above conjecture is true: since tau(2k-1) = 5, 2k-1 must be the 4th power of some prime p, i.e., k = (p^4 + 1)/2 (so p is odd, so p^4 == 1 (mod 16), so k is odd), and since tau(2k) = 4, 2k must be the product of two distinct primes, so k is an odd prime. Thus, the set of numbers k such that tau(2k) = 4 and tau(2k-1) = 5 is the set of primes of the form (p^4 + 1)/2, where p is prime. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Mar 17 2019",
