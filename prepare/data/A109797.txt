        "Compatible numbers were introduced by Sachs in analogy to amicable numbers, as admirable numbers are analogous to perfect numbers. Some terms have more than one counterpart (A109798), like 80 (two counterparts: 102 and 104) or 156 (3 counterparts: 210, 230 and 234). - _Amiram Eldar_, Oct 26 2019"
