        "According to Andree, Mr. James Jones of Moore, Oklahoma, has shown that 371280 can be expressed as a sum of two abundant numbers in more than 43000 different ways and that record-breaking values are likely to be multiples of 60. Indeed, except for the 19 terms 24, 36, 48, 84, 90, 96, 108, 144, 168, 216, 264, 288, 336, 408, 576, 588, 924, 1008, and 1428, apparently all the others are divisible by 60."
