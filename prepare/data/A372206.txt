        "Rational point is understood as F-rational point for F the number field of degree n over which some relevant elliptic curve E is defined.",
        "By a result of Pierre Parent building on work of Merel Lo\u00efc, Barry Mazur, Andrew Ogg and others the n-th term is effectively bounded by 65*(3^n-1)*(2n)^6.",
        "Denoting the set of all primes at most m by Primes(m) it holds that the set of all primes realized infinitely often as order of a rational point of an elliptic curve for a degree n number field is Primes(a(n)) for 1<=n<=8. It is unclear if this pattern continues.",
        "According to Derickx, Kamienny et al. (p. 2) the computation of the numbers in this sequence is a consequence of computing gonalities of certain modular curves. Derickx and van Hoeij describe in principle an algorithm that computes such gonalities, but in Remark 4 (p. 14) they comment on the difficulty of computing those gonalities for n>=9."
