        "No others up to 300000. Computed in collaboration with _Ray Chandler_. It appears that this sequence is finite, that is, that almost every positive integer is the sum of a semiprime and a square number. There are probably no further exceptions after a(12)=657.",
        "The statement about the finiteness of this sequence (namely, a(n)<=657) is much stronger than the Goldbach binary conjecture. Indeed, a much weaker conjecture, that this sequence contains no perfect squares >1, already implies the Goldbach conjecture. Cf. comment in A241922. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 01 2014",
