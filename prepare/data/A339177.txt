        "An arrangement of pseudocircles is a collection of simple closed curves on the sphere which intersect at most twice.",
        "In a NonKrupp-packed arrangement every pair of pseudocircles intersects in two proper crossings, no three pseudocircles intersect in a common points, and in every subarrangement of three pseudocircles there exist digons, i.e. faces bounded only by two of the pseudocircles."
