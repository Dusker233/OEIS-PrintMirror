        "A369659 is a subsequence of this sequence, giving the terms that are not multiples of 3. This follows because A083345(n) = n' / gcd(n',n) and from the following lemma: When k is not a multiple of 3, then either sopfr(k) [= A001414(k)] and k' [= A003415(k)] are both multiples of 3, or both are non-multiples of 3.",
        "Proof of the lemma: As k is not a multiple of 3, all its prime factors p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, ... (not necessarily all distinct) are either of the form 3m+1 or 3m-1. Let's first eliminate from k all triplets of primes that are of the same type modulo 3, either -1 or +1, (marked now as p, q, r) as they do not affect the divisibility by 3 of either the sopfr(k) or k'. In the case of the arithmetic derivative this is because we have k' = (pqr)' * (k/pqr) + (k/pqr)' * pqr, and as we know that the first summand is a multiple of 3 (because (pqr)' is), therefore the divisibility of the whole expression by 3 depends only on whether (k/pqr)' is a multiple of 3, as certainly pqr is not a multiple of 3.",
        "  What will remain after such elimination process has been completed as far as possible, must be either 1, or of the form p*q (p and q of different types), or p*q*r*s (with two primes of one type, and two primes of the other type), in which cases both sopfr(k) and k' are multiples of 3, or then alternatively, what remains must be of the form p*q (p and q of the same type), or p*q*r (with two primes of one type and the third of the other type), both cases which indicate that both sopfr(k) and k' are non-multiples of 3."
