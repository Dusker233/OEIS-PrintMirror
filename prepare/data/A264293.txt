        "The set of polynomials T is generated by these rules: 0 is in T, and if p is in T, then p + 1 is in T and x*p is in T and y*p is in T. The n-th generation of T consists of F(2n) polynomials, for n >= 0, where F = A000045 = Fibonacci numbers.",
        "Note that a given polynomial can appear only once; e.g., though x*y can arise either from multiplying x by y or y by x, it occurs only once in generation 3. Also although 0*x = 0, 0 occurs only in generation 0. - _Robert Israel_, Nov 22 2018"
