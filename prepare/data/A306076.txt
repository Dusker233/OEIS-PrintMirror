        "A prime p is called a unique-period prime in base b if there is no other prime q such that the period length of the base-b expansion of its reciprocal, 1/p, is equal to the period length of the reciprocal of q, 1/q.",
        "A prime p is a unique-period prime in base b if and only if Zs(b, 1, ord(b,p)) = p^k, k >= 1. Here Zs(b, 1, d) is the greatest divisor of b^d - 1 that is coprime to b^m - 1 for all positive integers m < d, and ord(b,p) is the multiplicative order of b modulo p.",

These are trivial bases in which p is a unique-period prime, with ord(b,p) = 1 or 2. By Faltings's theorem, there are only finitely many nontrivial bases in which p is also a unique-period prime, with ord(b,p) >= 3. For p = 11, the nontrivial bases are 2, 3."
