        "Indeed, 20160 is the smallest order for which there exist two nonisomorphic simple groups and it is the order of this group PSL_3(4) that was missing in the data. The first proof that there exist two nonisomorphic simple groups of this order was given by the American mathematician Ida May Schottenfels (1900) [see the link]. (End)"
