        "(a, b, c) is an ABC triple if gcd(a, b) = 1 and a + b = c. ABC triples with c > rad(a*b*c) are called \"abc-hits\". For primitive Pythagorean triples (u, v, w) it is u^2 + v^2 = w^2 and gcd(u^2, v^2) = 1. (u^2, v^2, w^2) are therefore ABC triples. They are then \"abc-hits\" if in addition w^2 > rad(u^2*v^2*w^2). If (u, v, w) is a non-primitive Pythagorean triple, (u^2, v^2, w^2) is not an ABC triple.",
