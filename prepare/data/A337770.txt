    "comment": [
        "This sequence bears similarities to the digit factorials, see A089718. However, unlike the digit factorials, we only multiply the leading digit of a(n-1) by n, instead of all digits present. As such, for indices greater than 4, a(n) includes all the digits from a(n-1), except those resulting from the lead digit of a(n-1) being multiplied by n.",
        "If one attempts this with the last digit of a(n-1) instead, 220 is the largest integer reached by the process. All indices greater than 4 yield the same number, as the last digit of 220 is 0 which, if multiplied by 5, results in itself and, if other digits remain consistent, causes 220 to repeat infinitely."
