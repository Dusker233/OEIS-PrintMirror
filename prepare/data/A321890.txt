        "Also primes of the form p^2 + q^4 where p and q are primes. The proof of the equivalence of the set of primes p^2 + q^4, where p and q are primes, with respect to this sequence, is the following: Exactly 1 of (p, q) giving a term is 2. q^4 + 4 is divisible by 5 and/or composite and gives no terms. - _David A.
