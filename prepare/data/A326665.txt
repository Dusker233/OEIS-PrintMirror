    "comment": [
        "The conditions that (a(n)) and (b(n)) be increasing and complementary force the equation a(n) = b(n-1) + b(a(n-1)), with initial value a(0) = 1, to have a unique solution; that is, as pair of complementary sequences (a(n)) = (1,5,11,10,...) and (b(n)) = (2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,12,...).  It appears that the 2nd difference sequence, (2,2,3,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,....), consists exclusively of 2s and 3s."
