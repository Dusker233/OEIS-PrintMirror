        "For additional terms, if the Goldbach Conjecture is assumed, take any odd term, subtract 1, and find two distinct primes that sum to it. For some numbers there will not be any pair of distinct primes. Multiply the two primes and the product is an element of the sequence. Note that this process does not work if the term - 1 is power of a prime. - _Nathaniel J. Strout_, Nov 25 2018"
