        "In more detail, the sequence is constructed as follows: Start with a(0) = 0. The missing numbers are 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... Add the first two, and we get 3, which is therefore a(1). Cross 1, 2, and 1+2=3 off the missing list. The first two missing numbers are now 4 and 5, so a(2) = 4+5 = 9. Cross off 4,5,9 from the missing list. Repeat.",

For example, a(1)=1+2=3, a(2)=4+5=9, a(3)=6+7=13, ... - Philippe Lallouet (philip.lallouet(AT)orange.fr), May 08 2008",

        "We see the Fibonacci numbers 3, 13, 89 and 233 occur in this sequence of anti-Fibonacci numbers. Are there infinitely many Fibonacci numbers occurring in (a(n))? The answer is yes: at least 13% of the Fibonacci numbers occur in (a(n)). This follows from Thomas Zaslavsky's formula, which implies that the sequence A017305 = (10n+3) is a subsequence of (a(n)). The Fibonacci sequence A000045 modulo 10 equals A003893, and has period 60. In this period, the number 3 occurs 8 times. - _Michel Dekking_, Feb 14 2019"
