        "a(n) = sqrt(A019547(n)); the sequence A019547 gives the squares themselves and this sequence gives the numbers whose squares yield the numbers in A019547. All multiples of 10 are included, because for any value of x, (x*10)^2 = x^2*100, which is x^2 followed by two zeros. Every digit except 6 is used as the last digit of a number in this sequence before 50. 6 is not used as the last digit of a number in this sequence until 306."
