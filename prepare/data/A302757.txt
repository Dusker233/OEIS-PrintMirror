    "comment": [
        "A126684 is described as the fastest-growing sequence such that every nonnegative integer is the sum of two of its terms. However, if one uses a greedy algorithm to find a representation as a sum of its terms, the length of the representation will typically be more than two. This sequence gives the numbers whose greedy representations have record-setting lengths. For example, a(3) = 13 because (although 13 = 8 + 5, a representation as a sum of two terms of A126684) the greedy algorithm represents it as the three-term sum 13 = 10 + 2 + 1."
