        "A bit sequence b_0, b_1, ..., b_k of the binary representation of an odd integer 2n+1 is self-describing if the largest real root beta of the monic polynomial p_n(x) = x^(k+1) - b_0 * x^k - b_1 * x^(k-1) - ... - b_k regenerates the same bit sequence when the beta transform t(x) = (beta * x) mod 1 is iterated for x=1, the generated bit being zero or one, depending on whether the modulo was taken or not. Not all integers n generate such self-describing polynomials; the sequence given here begins the list of valid self-describing polynomials.",

        "The binary representation for every integer 2n+1 encodes a polynomial p_n(x) but not all such polynomials have (positive, real) roots r_n that are self-describing. An integer n is valid if it is self-describing; the validity filter is theta_n(r_n) = 1 where theta_n(x) is recursively defined as theta_n(x) = theta_{n/2}(x) * (x < r_{n/2}) if n is even, and theta_n(x) = theta_{(n-1)/2}(x) if n is odd. The sequence starts with theta_0(x) = 1."
