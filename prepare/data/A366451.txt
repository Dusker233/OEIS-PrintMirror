        "A player chooses a target t > n and rolls a fair n-sided die repeatedly, keeping a running total of the numbers rolled. The player wins if t occurs in the sequence of running totals. a(n) is the choice of t that maximizes the probability of winning",
        "A fair die with sides numbered 1 through n is assumed.",
        "For given n, sum s occurs by adding one die role to a sum s-n .. s-1; so the probability p(s) of s occurring is p(s) = Sum_{i=1..n} p(s-i)*(1/n), i.e., the mean of the preceding n probabilities, and starting from p(0) = 1 for s=0 always occurring and p(s) = 0 for s < 0 never occurring.",
        "It is immediately apparent upon plotting the probabilities from sum s = n+1 onwards that the highest probability is achieved at s = a(n).",
        "It can be shown that, given the equation of n < s <= 2n, the maximum near a(n) is the only zero of the first derivative, and the second derivative is always negative, therefore any following probability must necessarily be less the maximum of the previous n probabilities, and therefore less than p(a(n)). Therefore any subsequent terms must then be less than p(a(n)). Because this is appending a rolling average of the previous n terms the probabilities dampen in their oscillations about a value of 2/(n+1)."
