        "Given a number k that is not only a term of this sequence but also has the property that the integer part of (10/9)^k is divisible by 9, we can expect that k+1 will likely also be a term of the sequence. E.g., k = 2189647 is a term because fract((10/9)^k) = 0.000000373557... < 0.000000456694... = 1/k, and since floor((10/9)^k) is divisible by 9, the integer and fractional parts of (10/9)^(k+1) will be exactly 10/9 times the integer and fractional parts of (10/9)^k, respectively, yielding a fractional part (10/9) * 0.000000373557... = 0.000000415064... < 0.000000456694... = 1/(k+1), so k+1 = 2189648 is also a term. - _Jon E.
