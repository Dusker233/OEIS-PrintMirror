        "Given a list of n move instructions (up, right, down, left), the snake starts at the origin and moves according to the instructions, in order. If an instruction tells it to move to a square that has already been visited, the snake skips that instruction. After it has followed (or skipped) the last instruction in the list, it starts again with the first one. a(n) is the number of lists of n instructions that results in the snake getting stuck at some point. Lists of instructions that are equivalent under rotations and reflections are counted only once, so we can for example assume that the first instruction is \"up\", and that the first \"right\" comes before the first \"left\". But how does  one know when to interrupt a snake and deem it infinite? - _Pontus von Br\u00f6mssen_, May 05 2022",
