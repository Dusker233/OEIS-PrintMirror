        "Similar sequences are obtained with a\u2019(1) a nonprime integer larger than 6, either a power of two or not. However, if a\u2019(1) is not a power of two, there exist at least, one integer: a\u2019(0) = ( a\u2019(1) +x)(1+x)) / (2x) with x a positive nontrivial divisor of a\u2019(1). Example: a\u2019(1) = 26, a\u2019(0) = 21, a\u2019(-1) = 16. (As a\u2019(-1) is a power of 2 there is not an a\u2019(-2) term). If a\u2019(1) = 6, a\u2019(0) = a\u2019(1) = a\u2019(2)\u2026= a\u2019(k) = 6."
