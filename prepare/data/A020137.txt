        "This sequence is a subsequence of the sequence A122785. In fact the terms are odd composite terms of A122785. Theorem: If both numbers q and 2q-1 are primes (q is in the sequence A005382) and n=q*(2q-1) then 8^(n-1)==1 (mod n) (n is in the sequence) iff q is of the form 12k+1. 2701,18721,49141,104653,226801,665281,721801,... is the related subsequence. This subsequence is also a subsequence of the sequence A122785. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Sep 15 2006",
