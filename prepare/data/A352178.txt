    "comment": [
        "Given distinct integers t_1, ..., t_n, form a graph G with n vertices labeled by the t_i, and with an edge from t_i to t_j, labeled t_i + t_j, whenever t_i + t_j is a power of 2.",

        "The following remarkable theorem is due to M. S. Smith (email of Mar 06 2022).",
        "Theorem: G contains no 4-cycles.",
        "Proof. Suppose the contrary, and assume the vertices t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 form a 4-cycle, with edges labeled b_1 = t_1+t_2, b_2 = t_2+t_3, b_3 = t_3+t_4, b_4 = t_4+t_1. The b_i are powers of 2.",
        "Since the t_i are distinct, b_1 != b_4, b_2 != b_1, b_3 != b_2, and b_4 != b_3.",
        "We also have",
        "   (*) b_1+b_3 = b_2+b_4 = t_1+t_2+t_3+t_4.",
        "However, the powers of 2 form a Sidon set (all pairwise sums are distinct), so (*) implies that either b_1=b_2 and b_3=b_4 or b_1=b_4 and b_3=b_2, both of which are impossible. QED",
        "Let c(n) = A006855(n) denote the maximum number of edges in a graph on n nodes containing no 4-cycle.",
        "Corollary: a(n) <= c(n).",
        "The values of c(n) agree with the lower bounds on a(n) for n <= 9 (see A347301), which establishes the first 9 values of a(n).",
        "Another corollary is that a(n) is bounded asymptotically by (n/4)*(sqrt(4n-3)+1) (see A006855).",
        "The theorem is remarkable, since before the only known values of a(n) were the trivial values for n <= 3.",
        "In summary, we have a(n) >= A347301(n) for n >= 6, and",

        "From this we can conclude that all cycles in the graph G must contain at least one negative number.",
