        "Consider an integer complexity measure c(n) which is the number of ones required to build n using +, -, *, and \"floor division\" which for convenience will be written in this entry (after Python notation) j//k = floor(j/k). In other words, c(n) is defined identically to A091333(n) except that this floor division is also allowed, and identically to the complexity b(n) described in A348069 except that division is extended to all pairs of natural numbers by taking the floor of the quotient. Clearly for all n, c(n) <= b(n) <= A091333(n). This sequence lists the integers k for which c(k) < A091333(k).",
        "Because of the inequality c(n) <= b(n) <= A091333(n), every entry in A348069 will eventually appear in this sequence. For example, the first term of A348069 is 50221174 = (7*3^15)//2, so we have c(50221174) = 53, b(50221174) = 54, and A091333(50221174) = 55.",
        "The extended domain of division means that terms of this sequence are much more frequent than A348069, but it's still quite rare for division to provide more compact expressions for natural numbers (except in the presence of exponentiation, see A348089)."
