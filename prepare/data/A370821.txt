    "comment": [
        "a(n) counts the minimal number of ternary words w = uv, with |w| = n, such that u is an irreducible prefix and v a primitive word. This defines a minimal \"pattern\", written as \"u(v)\", describing the behavior of a minimal n-state deterministic Mealy automaton outputting a string from a ternary alphabet, where u is the transient output, and v the cyclic output, possibly truncated. Used in the definition of the Deterministic Complexity (DC) of strings (Vieira and Budroni, 2022)."

This pattern is minimal, with 5 symbols (ignoring the parentheses). It describes the behavior of a minimal deterministic Mealy automaton producing the string w, leading to its Deterministic Complexity (DC) to be DC(w) = 5."
