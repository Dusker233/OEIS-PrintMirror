    "comment": [
        "Any nonzero number other than 4 or a prime could be chosen for a(1) so as to generate a nontrivial sequence (because A056240(r)=r for r=4 or a prime). In this sequence a(1) is set to 6 because it is the smallest composite number which is the sum of prime divisors of a greater number (8), and is therefore the smallest starting value for a non-stationary sequence of this kind. Let m = A056240(a(n-1)-q), where q is the greatest (prime or 4) < a(n-1)-1. Then a(n) = m*q, since sopfr(m*q) = sopf(m)+sopf(q) = a(n-1). Each term represents a step up (from the previous term) in the number of repeated iterations of sopfr required to reach a prime; a(n) >= A048133(n)."
