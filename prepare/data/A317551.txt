        "The fertility of a permutation pi is |s^{-1}(pi)|, where s is West's stack-sorting map. A nonnegative integer is called a fertility number if it is the fertility of some permutation.",
        "The set of fertility numbers is closed under multiplication.",
        "Every nonnegative integer that is not congruent to 3 modulo 4 is a fertility number.",
        "The lower asymptotic density of this sequence is at least 0.7618. In particular, there are infinitely many fertility numbers that are congruent to 3 modulo 4. The smallest of these is 27. It appears as though 95 is the second-smallest fertility number that is congruent to 3 modulo 4.",
        "It is conjectured that there are infinitely many positive integers that are not fertility numbers.",
        "Empirically found 149 terms congruent 3 mod 4, the second smallest being 39 followed by 51, 63, 95, 123, ... - _Jon Maiga_, Oct 28 2018"
