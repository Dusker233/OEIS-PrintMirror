        "If F(k) is the k-th Fibonacci number A000045(k), then p(k)=F(k-1)/2^k is a normalized probability distribution on the positive integers.",
        "For example, it is the probability that k coin tosses are required to get two heads in a row, or the probability that a random series of k bits has its first two consecutive 1's at the end.",
        "The g.f. for this distribution is g(x) = x^2/(4-2x-x^2) = (1/4)x^2 + (1/8)x^3 + (1/8)x^4 + (3/32)x^5 + ....",
        "The cumulants of this distribution, defined by the cumulant e.g.f. log(g(e^x)), appear to be integers. They form sequence A302926.",
        "The cumulants appear to be even for n >= 0. Dividing them by 2 gives this sequence.",
        "The n-th moments about zero of this distribution, known as raw moments, are defined by a(n) = Sum_{k>=1} (k^n)p(k). They also appear to be integers and form sequence A302922.",
        "For n >= 1, the raw moments also appear to be even. Dividing them by 2 gives sequence A302923.",
        "The central moments (i.e., the moments about the mean) also appear to be integers. They form sequence A302924.",
        "For n >= 1, the central moments appear to be even. Dividing them by 2 gives sequence A302925.",
        "Note: Another probability distribution on the positive integers that has integral moments and cumulants is the geometric distribution p(k)=1/2^k. The sequences related to these moments are A000629, A000670, A052841, and A091346."
