        "The puzzle is as follows. An n X n grid is filled with distinct integers from 1 to n*n, such that the number at row r and column c (both 0-based) is n*n - (r*n + c). The task is to perform rotations of 2 X 2 sub-grids (moves) to bring the numbers into their natural order, i.e., the number at row r and column c should become r*n + c + 1. Rotations are by 90 degrees in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. See links for example puzzles and solutions.",
