    "name": "Number of sets in the geometry determined by the Hausdorff metric at each location between two sets defined by a complete bipartite graph K(6,n) (with n at least 4) missing three edges, where exactly two removed edges are incident to the same vertex in the 6-point set and exactly two removed edges are incident to the same vertex in the other set.",
    "comment": [
        "Start with a complete bipartite graph K(6,n) with vertex sets A and B where |A| = 6 and |B| is at least 4. We can arrange the points in sets A and B such that h(A,B) = d(a,b) for all a in A and b in B, where h is the Hausdorff metric. The pair [A,B] is a configuration. Then a set C is between A and B at location s if h(A,C) = h(C,B) = h(A,B) and h(A,C) = s. Call a pair ab, where a is in A and b is in B an edge. This sequence provides the number of sets between sets A' and B' at location s in a new configuration [A',B'] obtained from [A,B] by removing three edges, where exactly two removed edges are incident to the same point in A and exactly two removed edges are incident to the same point in B. So this sequence tells the number of sets at each location on the line segment between A' and B'.",

        "Take a complete bipartite graph K(6,n) (with n at least 4) having parts A and B where |A| = 6. This sequence gives the number of edge covers of the graph obtained from this K(6,n) graph after removing three edges, where exactly two removed edges are incident to the same vertex in A and exactly two removed edges are incident to the same vertex in B."
