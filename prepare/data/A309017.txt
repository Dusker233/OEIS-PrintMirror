        "There are no further terms since the cubes between 28 and 50 that have the highest sums of digits are 31, 46 and 49. The sum of digits of the cubes of 31, 46 and 49 are 28. 28 is not divisible by 31, 46 or 49. So it is impossible that any number greater than 50 can divide the sum of digits of its cube.",
        "0 is not in the term because 0 divided by 0 is undefined."

        "8 is in the sequence because 8^3 = 512 and 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8/8 = 1."
