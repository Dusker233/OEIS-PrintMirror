        "If q is not a power of 2, then a(n) is the number of pairs of consecutive nonzero squares in the finite field F_q. In other words, a(n) is the number of solutions to x^((q-1)/2) = (x+1)^((q-1)/2) = 1 in F_q. This can be proved by generalizing the argument of Jack D'Aurizio to the Math Stack Exchange question \"Existence of Consecutive Quadratic residues\" to the case of F_q."
