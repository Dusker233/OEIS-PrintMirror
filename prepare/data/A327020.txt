    "comment": [
        "A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets. Its elements are sometimes called edges, The dual of a set-system has, for each vertex, one edge consisting of the indices (or positions) of the edges containing that vertex. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,3}} is {{1},{1,2},{2}}. An antichain is a set of sets, none of which is a subset of any other. This sequence counts antichains with union {1..n} whose dual is pairwise intersecting."
