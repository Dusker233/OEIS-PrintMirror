        "LCM(1..k) is a common denominator for the harmonic numbers, and the present terms k are where the sum reduces to a smaller denominator (A002805).",
        "We can find a prime p and a pair of positive integers t < p and o for every positive integer k that p^o*t <= k < p^o*(t+1). For positive integers i that are not divisible by p^o, a multiple of p will be added to the numerator of the reciprocal sum; for i's that are divisible by p^o, the number that will be added to the numerator of the reciprocal sum is divisible by r(t). So k is in the sequence if and only if p^o*t <= k < p^o*(t+1) where p is a prime and p divides r(t).",
        "The sequence is the answer to Problem 23 of the 2022 AMC12A."
