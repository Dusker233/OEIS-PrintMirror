        "For a given integer m, write its binary representation in reverse order, as in A125626, A125754, etc.; let a 0 mean \"halving\" and a 1 mean \"k -> 3k+1\". Then m specifies an operation on real numbers given by k -> f_m(k). Suppose the equation f_m(k) = k has a positive integer solution for some m. Then we conjecture that the values of k are precisely the terms of this sequence.",
