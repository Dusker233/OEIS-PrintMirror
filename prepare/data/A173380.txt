        "Fisher and Hiley give 396204 as their last term instead of 396172 (see A002932).  Douglas McNeil confirms 396172 (see seqfan discussion).",
        "Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 27 2010: Joseph Myers has discovered that several of the sequences listed by Fisher and Riley (1961) contained errors. R. J. Mathar comments that this article has 62 citations in http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1961JChPh..34.1253F and that clicking through these with the \"Citations to the Article (62)\" button is one way to check the numbers by searching for corrections.",
        "From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jan 01 2019: (Start)",
        "Nemirovsky et al. (1992), for a d-dimensional hypercubic lattice, define C_{n,m} to be \"the number of configurations of an n-bond self-avoiding chain with m neighbor contacts.\" For d=2 (square lattice) and m=0 (no neighbor contacts), we have (for the current sequence) a(n) = C(n, m=0). These values (from n=1 to n=11) are listed in Table I (p. 1088) in the paper.",
        "According to Eq. (5), p. 1090, in the above paper, for a general d, the partition number C_{n,m} satisfies C_{n,m} = Sum_{l=1..n} 2^l*l!*Bin(d,l)*p_{n,m}^{(l)}, where the coefficients p_{n,m}^{(l)} (l=1,2,...) are independent of d. For d=2 (square lattice), this becomes C_{n,m} = Sum_{l=1..n} 2^l*l!*Bin(2,l)*p_{n,m}^{(l)}.",
        "According to Eq. (7a) and (7b), p. 1093, in the paper, p_{n,0}^{(1)} = 1 = p_{n,0}^{(n)}, p_{n,m}^{(1)} = 0 for m >= 1, and p_{n,m}^{(l)} = 0 for m >= 1 and n-m+1 <= l <= n.",
        "Now, assume d=2. Since p_{n,0}^{(1)} = 1 for n >= 1, we have C_{1,0} = 2^1*1!*Bin(2,1)*1 = 4, while C_{n,0} = 4 + 2^2*2!*Bin(2,2)*p_{n,0}^{(2)} = 4 + 8*p_{n,0}^{(2)} for n >= 2. The partition numbers p_{n,0}^{(2)} appear in Table II, p. 1093, in the paper. We have p_{n,0}^{(2)} = A038746(n) (with p_{1,0}^{(2)} = 0 to make the formula C_{n,0} = 4 + 8*p_{n,0}^{(2)} valid even for n=1).",
