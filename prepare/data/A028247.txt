        "A T-frame is a polyomino whose boundary word has the form x^a y^b x^c y^d x^-e y^-f x^g y^-h, where a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are positive integers. The boundary word is determined by moving counterclockwise around the boundary of the polyomino. The symbols x and y represent unit steps to the right and up, respectively, while x^-1 and y^-1 represent steps to the left and down. - _David Radcliffe_, Jan 31 2023",
        "Equivalently, polyominoes which are integral rectangles with integral notches cut from two adjacent corners; or right-angled octagons with integral sides, and as you traverse the perimeter counterclockwise you encounter turns in the order LLLLRLLR. - _Allan C. Wechsler_, from seqfans mailing list, Jan 31 2023.",
