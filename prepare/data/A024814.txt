        "The difference between a(n) and a(n+1) is 22 for a(2) through a(16). Then the difference between a(n) and a(n+1) is 355 for a(17) through a(162). Then it appears that the difference is 104348 for at least some terms beginning with a(163) but computing subsequent terms of the sequence is very slow so it is not easy to know whether or for how long that 104358 difference persists. - _Harvey P.
