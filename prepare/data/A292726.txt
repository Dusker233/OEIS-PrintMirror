        "Consider the inverse operation: either divide an even stack in two, or replace two stacks of equal parity with their averages. The states which have no inverse moves are precisely those with all parts equal and odd. If n is a power of two, its only odd divisor is 1 and so every state can be inverted to the all-ones state, and if n is an odd prime then the only states which cannot be inverted are the all-ones state and [n]. If n has an odd divisor d with 1 < d < n, then unreachable states include the all-d's state and any state obtainable from it by combining d's in pairs, of which there is at least one. Therefore, both conjectures are true. - _Charlie Neder_, Jan 28 2019"
