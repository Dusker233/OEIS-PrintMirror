    "comment": [
        "The inverse of an orthogonal matrix is its transpose. This implies the dot product of a row with itself must be 1. This further implies the number of ones in each row must be odd. Given that orthogonal matrices form a group, it must be the case the transpose is also an orthogonal matrix. This requires every column of a binary orthogonal matrix also have an odd number of ones.",
