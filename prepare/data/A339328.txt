        "This correlation between A240471 and A115588 contains some apparently random component.",
        "If the integer part of the harmonic mean of divisors of m equals 1 we will find an 1 in A115588(m) too, for all m. If the integer part of the harmonic mean of divisors of m equals 2 we will find 2 in A115588(m) too, with probability of ~0.9877 for m in range 2-1000.",
        "For m until 10000 the only exceptions are 16 and 27. If the integer part of the harmonic mean of divisors of m equals 3 we will find 3 in A115588(m) too, with probability of ~0.1983 for m in range 2-1000. For integer parts greater than 3 the probability gets fast smaller.",
