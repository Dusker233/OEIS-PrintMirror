        "Decompose the multiplicative group of integers modulo k as a product of cyclic groups C_{s_1} x C_{s_2} x ... x C_{s_m}, where s_i divides s_j for i < j, then k is a term iff s_1 is divisible by 6. For k = 1 or 2, (Z/kZ)* is the trivial group, s_1 does not exist so 1 and 2 are also terms.",
        "If gcd(k_1, k_2) = 1 and both k_1 and k_2 are in this sequence, so is k_1*k_2. For example, 7 and 9 are both here so 7*9 = 63 is also here. Indeed, the number of solutions to x^6 == 1 (mod 7), x^6 == 1 (mod 9) and x^6 == 1 (mod 36) are 6, 6 and 36, respectively.",
        "This is an analog of A008784, since k is a term there iff s_1 (defined as above) is divisible by 4 instead of 6. But on the other hand, if k is in A008784, so are all its divisors, while this is not true for this sequence. However, if k is here and k is not divisible by 9, then all its divisors are also here.",
