        "A \"winning path\" on any given Tak board is defined to be any path that connects one side of the grid to the opposite side, consistent with a path as defined by the rules of the game (see link), and which does not include within it a more direct winning path (a \"shortcut\").",
        "The given terms (1, 4, 14, 56, 302) were generated by a combination of brute-force enumeration and generation by computer program (subsequently verified against an enumerated list).",
        "Conjectured terms above n=5, generated by computer program, are 2012, 22574, 534312, 24816752, and 1908479044."
