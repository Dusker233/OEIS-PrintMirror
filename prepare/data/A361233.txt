        "Let k be a positive integer and consider the Pisano cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo k. We define the \"Pisano cycle modulo k shape\" to be the 2-dimensional shape obtained by applying the following process:",
        "Step 1: Start from the origin of a 2-dimensional grid.",
        "Step 2: Consider the first number of the Pisano cycle: if it's 0, then stay still in the position you were before; otherwise, if it's even, then turn 90 degrees counterclockwise and take a 1-unit step; if it's odd, then turn 90 degrees clockwise and take a 1-unit step.",
        "Step 3: Continue this process for all the numbers in the Pisano cycle modulo n.",
        "Step 4: When you have applied the above rules to all the numbers, repeat the entire process again and again, each time starting from the position where the previous iteration ended.",
        "Some shapes seem to repeat; for example, the shapes associated with k = 6, 12, 14 are the same.",
        "The condition for being bounded is that after processing one iteration of the Pisano cycle then either current direction must be different from the initial direction or the current position must be the origin."
