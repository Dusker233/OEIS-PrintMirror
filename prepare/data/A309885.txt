        "The next term, a(5), is at least 351. Is it true a(5)=351? Proving a value is a term of the sequence is hard. Extensive computations suggest a(5)=351 should be the next term.",
        "Can we find lower bounds for a(6), a(7), ...? For example, a(6) >= 2200 which can be obtained by using the set of integers {2, 10, 13, 30, 49, 56}. Can we find better sets for n=6 ?",
        "By \"set of n integers\" it is meant that a fixed set of exactly n not necessarily distinct positive integers is used for obtaining every number from 1 to a(n).",
        "This sequence is similar to A142153, but there not all integers from the set must be used when building numbers, and here we are taking a(n) to be the \"last obtainable number\", instead of the \"highest smallest unobtainable\" number which is one more than the last obtainable number.",
        "We can use A142153(n+1)-1 > a(n) for a upper bound, for n > 1. For a lower bound, we can use a(n) >= A309886(n)-1, where the inequality is strict for n > 3.",
        "For a trivial, not sharp, upper bound, we can count the possible expressions that can be built with n digits and allowed operations, and find (taking into consideration +,* are commutative): A221954(n) > a(n), for n > 1."
