        "It is conjectured (see A090252) that the indices of even terms in A090252 are {3*2^i-1, i >= 0} (A083329), so the positive terms of the present sequence should be a subsequence of A083329.",
        "For n = 1,...,18, the terms are 3*2^k - 1 for k = 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,9,11,13,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28. Will the formula a(n) = 3*2^(2*n-8)-1 hold for all n >= 11? This appears to be yet another example of the influence of A029744 on A090252 and A354691.- _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 24 2022"
