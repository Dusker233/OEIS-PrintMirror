        "A stable partition of a hypergraph or set system is a set partition of the vertices where no non-singleton edge has all its vertices in the same block. The chromatic symmetric function is given by X_G = Sum_pi m(t(pi)) where the sum is over all stable partitions pi of G, t(pi) is the integer partition whose parts are the block-sizes of pi, and m is the basis of augmented monomial symmetric functions (see A321895). A hypergraph or set system is e-positive if, in the expansion of its chromatic symmetric function in terms of elementary functions, all coefficients are nonnegative."
