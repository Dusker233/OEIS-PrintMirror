        "A unicursal star is a closed loop formed by diagonals of a regular n-gon.",
        "These are Hamiltonian cycles on the graph complement of the n-cycle.",

        "These are counted up to rotation and reflection, i.e., modulo dihedral symmetry of the n-gon.",
        "Inspired by a unicursal dodecagram drawn by Gordon FitzGerald (see links)."
