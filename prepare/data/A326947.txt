        "The dual of a set-system has, for each vertex, one block consisting of the indices (or positions) of the blocks containing that vertex. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,3}} is {{1},{1,2},{2}}. The T_0 condition means that the dual is strict (no repeated edges).",
        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every finite set of finite nonempty sets has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges."
