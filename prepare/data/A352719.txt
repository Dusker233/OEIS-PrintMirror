    "comment": [
        "The tribonacci constant, which is approximately 1.839, is described in A058265. The tribonacci constant is the only real solution to the characteristic equation (x^3 = x^2+x+1) for the tribonacci sequence. It describes the asymptotic growth of the tribonacci sequence.",

    "example": [
        "T(6) = 7 and T(7) = 13. Therefore, T(7) - (tribonacci constant)*T(6) equals approximately 0.127 > 0. Thus, index 6 is in this sequence."
