        "\"Enclosing\" means that any edge runs outside the circle or is a tangent.",
        "Such a polygon does not need to be symmetrical, but the partial areas in the four quadrants are equal. Therefore it is sufficient to find the least area of a quarter polygon (multiplied by 2). The half area is an integer because the area of any convex polygon whose vertex coordinates are integers is a multiple of 1/2. The least number of polygons minimizing the area is 16 if x=y is not an axis of symmetry (2 solutions for each quadrant)."
