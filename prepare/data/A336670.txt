(These observations assume the number has at least two digits.)",
        "Schuh (pp. 31-35) uses the solution to this problem to solve the \"doubles puzzle\": find all numbers (with no initial 0) that are written with the same digits as their double (the double of k is 2*k). These numbers are listed in A023086.",
        "The number 0 has been included here for two reasons: (i) we may assume that it satisfies the conditions of the problem vacuously, and (ii) its inclusion allows Schuh to solve the \"doubles puzzle\". The numbers in A023086 are all permutations of combinations of numbers in this sequence."
