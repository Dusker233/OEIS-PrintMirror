        "In terms of the repetition convolution operator #, where (sequence A) # (sequence B) = the sequence consisting of A(n) copies of B(n), then this sequence is the repetition convolution A110595 # n. Over the set of positive infinite integer sequences, # gives a nonassociative noncommutative groupoid (magma) with a left identity (A000012) but no right identity, where the left identity is also a right nullifier and idempotent. For any positive integer constant c, the sequence c*A000012 = (c,c,c,c,...) is also a right nullifier; for c = 1, this is A000012; for c = 3 this is A010701."
