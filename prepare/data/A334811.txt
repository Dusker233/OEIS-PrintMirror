        "A word is \"overlap-free\" if it contains no block of the form axaxa, where a is a single letter and x is a (possibly empty) block.   The \"period\" of a word w is an integer p, 1 <= p <= |w|, such that w[i] = w[i+p] for all indices i that make sense.  A nonempty word w trivially has period |w|."
