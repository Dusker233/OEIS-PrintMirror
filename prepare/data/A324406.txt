    "comment": [
        "Redelmeier uses these rings to enumerate polyominoes of the regular tiling {4,4} with fourfold rotational symmetry (A144553) and an even number of cells. Each cell of a polyomino ring is adjacent to (shares an edge with) exactly two other cells. For oriented rings, chiral pairs (though congruent) are counted as two.",
        "For n odd, the center of the ring is a vertex of the tiling; for n even, the center is the center of a tile.",

        "For a(1)=1, the four cells form a square. For a(2)=1, the eight cells form a 3 X 3 square with the center cell omitted. For a(3)=1, the twelve cells form a 4 X 4 square with the four inner cells omitted. For a(4)=2, the sixteen cells of one ring form a 5 X 5 square with the nine inner cells omitted; the other ring is similar, but with each corner cell omitted and replaced with the cell diagonally toward the center from that corner cell."
