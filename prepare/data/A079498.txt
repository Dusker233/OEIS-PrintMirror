    "comment": [
        "In base 2 this gives the \"Evil Numbers\" (cf. A001969). One may conjecture that in base b the asymptotic slope will be b and asymptotic density 1/b for each result (mod b). Cases b=31 or b=61 gave considerable number of primes on the sequence.",
        "Proof of this conjecture: in general, the sequence d with terms d(n) = sum of digits of n written in base b (mod b) is a fixed point of the generalized Thue-Morse morphism 0->01..b-1, 1->12..0, etc. See A053839 for the case b=4. It follows directly from this that all symbols have asymptotic density 1/b, and therefore that the positional sequences all have asymptotic slope b. - _Michel Dekking_, Apr 18 2019",
