    "comment": [
        "This sequence is the multiplicative counterpart to A130232, but the initial term 0 is replaced with 10 (0 obviously results in A000004). The data demonstrates that the number of 0's grows rapidly as a(n) increases, because each term is a multiple of 10, thus adding at least one 0 to successive terms."
