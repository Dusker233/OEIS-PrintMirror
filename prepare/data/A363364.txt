        "A graph is weakly pancyclic if it contains cycles of all lengths between its girth and its circumference. Acyclic graphs are considered to be weakly pancyclic.",

        "Brandt (1997) conjectures that a(n) = floor((n-1)*(n-3)/4) + 5 for n >= 6. The conjecture is false for n = 8, since there exists a (unique) non-bipartite, not weakly pancyclic graph (shown below) with 8 nodes and 13 edges, showing that a(8) >= 14. This graph contains cycles of lengths 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, but none of length 7.",
