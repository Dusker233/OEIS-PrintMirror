    "comment": [
        "This sequence gives the number of self-avoiding walks on a 2-dimensional square lattice where the walk starts with a step length of 1 which then increments at each step to the next square number until the step length is n^2.",
        "The first time a collision with a previous step can occur is for n = 8, i.e., a walk with step lengths of 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64. For a walk with one or more initial steps to the right followed by an upward step this can occur in nine different ways. For example, consider a walk with steps of length 1,4,9,16,25 to the right, a step of length 36 upward, then a step of length 49 to the left. A step of length 64 downward would now result in a collision. Requiring eight steps before a collision is in contrast to the standard 2D square lattice SAW of A001411 where a collision can occur on the fourth step."

However, nine of these are forbidden due to the collisions given in the comments, leaving 1084 in total. These can be walked in eight different ways on the 2D grid. There are also the four straight walks along the axes. This gives a total of 1084*8 + 4 = 8676 walks."
