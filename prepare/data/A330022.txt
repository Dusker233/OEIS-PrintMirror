        "Greedy supersequence algorithms give the upper bounds a(7) <= 60, a(8) <= 74, a(9) <= 142, a(10) <= 180, a(11) <= 344, a(12) <= 410, a(13) <= 798. Probably some of these are tight. The value for a(6) was computed by checking all 8! arrangements of the 8 palindromes of length 3, optimizing overlaps. Probably someone with more computing power could compute a(7) (resp., a(8)) by checking all 16! = 20922789888000 arrangements of the palindromes of length 7 (resp., 8)."
