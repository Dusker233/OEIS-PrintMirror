        "This is related to the gerrymandering question. What is the asymptotic behavior of a(n)? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 20 2021. Answer from _Don Reble_, Feb 26 2020: The lower bound is [(n^2+1)/4 + n/2]; the upper bound is [n^2/4 + n]. Each bound is reached infinitely often. In general the best choice for d is not unique, since d and n/d give the same answer."
