    "comment": [
        "Heat-Charge Toggle is an impartial two-player game on a finite simple graph, where each vertex is assigned a weight of -1, 0, or 1.",
        "A Heat-Charge Toggle move consists of selecting a vertex of weight 1 and switching its weight to 0, as well as switching the sign of each of its neighbors: changing 1 to -1, -1 to 1, and keeping 0 at 0.",
        "We additionally only allow moves that strictly decrease the sum of all weights.",
        "The two vertices of degree one have initial weights of -1, while vertices of degree two have an initial weight of 1."
