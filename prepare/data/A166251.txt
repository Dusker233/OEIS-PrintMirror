        "Other formulation:  Suppose a prime p >= 5 lies in the interval (2p_k, 2p_(k+1)), where p_n is the n-th prime; p is called isolated if the interval (2p_k, 2p_(k+1)) does not contain any other primes.",
        "The sequence is connected with the following classification of primes: The first two primes 2,3 form a separate set of primes; let p >= 5 be in interval(2p_k, 2p_(k+1)), then 1)if in this interval there are primes only more than p, then p is called a right prime; 2) if in this interval there are primes only less than p, then p is called a left prime; 3) if in this interval there are prime more and less than p, then p is called a central prime; 4) if this interval does not contain other primes, then p is called an isolated prime. In particular, the right primes form sequence A166307 and all Ramanujan primes (A104272) more than 2 are either right or central primes; the left primes form sequence A182365 and all Labos primes (A080359) greater than 3 are either left or central primes.",
