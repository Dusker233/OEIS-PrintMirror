        "It can be proved using the division algorithm for Gaussian integers that S is the set of Gaussian rational numbers: (b + c*i)/d, where b,c,d are integers and d is not 0.",
        "Empirically, it appears that a(n) = A233694(n+2) + 7 for n > 2. It seems clear that positive integers appear for the first time at the start of a new level of the tree. If this is always the case, then the row starting with n will be followed by a row starting n+1, 1/n, ni, followed by a row starting n+2, 1/(n+1), (n+1)i, 1+1/n, n+1, i/(n+1), 1+ni, -i/n, -n. It may be possible to show that of these 9 values, only n+1 has ever appeared before. If so, then -n will always appear exactly 7 places after n + 2 in the sequence. - _Jack W Grahl_, Aug 10 2018"
