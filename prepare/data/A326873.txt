        "We define a connectedness system (investigated by Vim van Dam in 2002) to be a set of finite nonempty sets (edges) that is closed under taking the union of any two overlapping edges.",
        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every finite set of finite nonempty sets has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.",
        "The enumeration of these set-systems by number of covered vertices is given by A326877."
