        "3 is a cube mod p for all primes in this list; this is a particular case of a result of Gauss. See Ireland and Rosen, Chapter 9, Exercise 23, p. 135. Some examples are given below.",
        "Primes p such that 4*p - 243 is a square. Let p == 1 (mod 6) be a prime. There are integers c and d such that 4*p = c^2 + 27*d^2 (see, for example, Ireland and Rosen, Proposition 8.3.2). This sequence lists the primes with d = 3. Cf. A005471 (case d = 1) and A227622 (case d = 2).",

        "Note that the roots of x^3 - p*x + 3*p are the differences n_0 - n_1, n_1 - n_2 and n_2 - n_0, where n_0, n_1 and n_2 are the three cubic Gaussian periods for the modulus p.",
        "(2) The cubic x^3 - m*x^2 - 3*(m + 9)*x - 27 has discriminant (3*p)^2, a square. This is the polynomial g_3(a, 0, -3; X) in the notation of Hashimoto and Hoshi. The cubic is irreducible over Q by the Rational Root Theorem and hence the Galois group of the polynomial over Q is the cyclic group C_3.",
        "(3) The cubic 3*x^3 + p*(x + 3)^2, with discriminant 81*p^2*(4*p - 243), a square, is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criteria. It follows that the Galois group of the polynomial over Q is the cyclic group C_3."
