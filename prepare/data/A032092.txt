        "Let k be an integer >= 2. The g.f. of the BHK[k] transform of the sequence (c(n): n >= 1), with g.f. C(x) = Sum_{n>=1} c(n)*x^n, is A_k(x) = (C(x)^k - C(x^2)^(k/2))/2 if k is even, and A_k(x) = (C(x)/2)*(C(x)^{k-1} - C(x^2)^{(k-1)/2}) if k is odd. This follows easily from the formulae in C. G. Bower's web link below about transforms.",
        "When k is even and c(n) = 1 for all n >= 1, we get C(x) = x/(1-x) and A_k(x) = (1/2)*((x/(1-x))^k - (x^2/(1-x^2))^{k/2}). If (a_k(n): n >= 1) is the output sequence (with g.f. A_k(x)), then it can be proved (using Taylor expansions) that a_k(n) = (1/2)*(binomial(n-1, n-k) - binomial((n/2)-1, (n-k)/2)) for even n >= k+1 and a_k(n) = (1/2)*binomial(n-1, n-k) for odd n >= k+1. (Clearly, a_k(1) = ... = a_k(k) = 0.)",
        "In this sequence, k = 6, and (according to C. G. Bower) a(n) = a_{k=6}(n) is the number of reversible non-palindromic compositions of n with 6 positive parts. If n = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 + b_6 is such a composition of n (with b_i >= 1), then it is equivalent to the composition n = b_6 + b_5 + b_4 + b_3 + b_2 + b_1, and each equivalent class has two elements because here linear palindromes are not allowed as compositions of n.",
        "The fact that we are finding the BHK[6] transform of 1, 1, 1, ... means that each part of each composition of n can have exactly one color (see Bower's link below about transforms).",
        "In each such composition replace each b_i with one black (B) ball followed by b_i - 1 white (W) balls. Then drop the first black (B) ball. We then get a reversible non-palindromic string of length n-1 that has 5 black balls and n-6 white balls. This process, applied to the equivalent compositions n = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 + b_6 = b_6 + b_5 + b_4 + b_3 + b_2 + b_1, gives two strings of length n-1 with 5 black balls and n-6 white balls that are mirror images of each other.",
        "Hence, for n >= 2, a(n) = a_{k=6}(n) is also the number of reversible non-palindromic strings of length n-1 that have k-1 = 5 black balls and n-k = n-6 white balls. (Clearly, a(n) = a_{k=6}(n) > 0 only for n >= 7.)",
