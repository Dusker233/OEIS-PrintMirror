        "Sequence is finite, since for large k and suitable constants and epsilon: phi(k) - 2*tau(k) > c1*k^(2/3) - 4*c2*k^(1/2) > 0 if k > c3, so phi(k) - 2*tau(k) > 0, QED. Moreover, phi(k) = m*tau(k) has at most finitely many solutions for any constant m or even for slowly increasing functions like m(k) = k^(epsilon). - _Labos Elemer_, Jul 20 2001"
