    "comment": [
        "A knight's graph is a graph that represents all legal moves of the knight chess piece on a chessboard. Each vertex of this graph represents a square of the chessboard, and each edge connects two squares that are a knight's move apart from each other.",
        "Two polygons in the knight's graph are called congruent if one can be transformed into the other by applying one or more of the operations of translation, rotation, and reflection on the chessboard; otherwise, they are non-congruent.",
        "This sequence, in contrast to A366778, considers only simple, i.e., non-self-intersecting polygons."
