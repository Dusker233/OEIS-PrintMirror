        "The difficulty is that the final-letter-removed mechanism does not give the usual iteration scheme. The crucial observation is that",
        "      N1(n) = a(n-1)/2.",

        "Next we compute the length a(n) of theta(n). Let N00(n-1) be the number of blocks 00 occurring at even positions in theta(n-1), and let delta(n)= 0 if the final letter was not removed to obtain theta(n), and delta(n)= 1 if the final letter was removed. Then",

        "We have N00(n-1) = a(n-1)/2 - N1(n-1), and delta(n) = a(n)/2 - 2*floor(a(n)/2). The latter gives an awkward formula when substituted in (*), so we note that delta(n) is 1 iff N1(n-1) is odd iff a(n-2)/2 is odd. This gives delta(n) = a(n-2)/2 - 2*floor(a(n-2)/4). Substituting all this in (*) yields",
