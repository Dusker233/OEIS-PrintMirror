        "Let S be a set of n elements. First we perform a set partition on S. Let SU be the set of all nonempty subsets of S. As is well known, 2^n - 1 is the number of nonempty subsets of a set with n elements (see A000225). That is, 2^n - 1 is the number of elements |SU| of SU. In the second step, we select k elements from SU. We want to know how many different selections are possible. Let W be the resulting set of selections formed from SU. Then the number of elements |W| of W is |W| = Sum_{k=1..2^n-1} binomial(2^n-1,k) = 2^(2^n-1) - 1 = A077585. Example: |W(n)| = a(n=2) = 7, because W = {[[1, 2]], [[1]], [[1, 2], [1]], [[1, 2], [2], [1]], [[1, 2], [2]], [[2], [1]], [[2]]}. - _Thomas Wieder_, Nov 08 2007",
        "These are so-called double Mersenne numbers, sometimes denoted MM(n) where M = A000225. MM(n) is prime iff M(n) = 2^n-1 is a Mersenne prime exponent (A000043), which isn't possible unless n itself is also in A000043. Primes of this form are called double Mersenne primes MM(p). For all Mersenne exponents between 7 and 61, factors of MM(p) are known. MM(61) is far too large for any currently known primality test, but a distributed search for factors of this and other MM(p) is ongoing, see the doublemersenne.org web site. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 05 2020",
