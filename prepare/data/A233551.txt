        "419 is in the sequence. Consider (419*4^m+1)/3: for m == 0 (mod 6) it is divisible by 5 and 7, for m == 1 (mod 6) divisible by 13, for m == 2 (mod 6) divisible by 3 and 5, for m == 3 (mod 6) divisible by 7, for m == 4 (mod 6) divisible by 5 and for m == 5 (mod 6) divisible by 3. The \"mod 6\" is derived from the fact that 4^6-1 = 3^2*5*7*13, so 4^6 == 1 (mod 5), 4^6 == 1 (mod 7), 4^6 = 1 (mod 9) and 4^6 == 1 (mod 13). - _Andrew Weimholt_, May 26 2019",
