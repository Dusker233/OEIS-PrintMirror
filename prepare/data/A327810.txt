        "Most numbers in A279092 do not belong to this sequence. That is, \"unbalanced\" consecutive palindromes are much rarer than \"balanced\" consecutive palindromes.",
        "Specifically, any subsequence of this sequence that is given by fixing the maximum allowed number of digits in the consecutive bases seems to be finite. In contrast, every such subsequence of A279092 is known to be infinite."
