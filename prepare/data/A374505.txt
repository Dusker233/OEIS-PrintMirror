        "It is conjectured that this construction gives the maximal number of axis-parallel unit squares that can be packed into a circle of diameter n.",
        "From the Erich Friedman website the best known maximum number of unit squares enclosed by a circle of diameter n are for n >= 2: 1, 4, 8, 14, 21, 30, ... (this sequence has not been included in OEIS because the terms have not been proven optimal). The unit squares in this case are not required to be axis-parallel. However, the example of 30 axis-parallel squares enclosed in a circle of radius < 3.5 shows that if holes are allowed, better packings are possible than with the restricted case. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jul 14 2024"
