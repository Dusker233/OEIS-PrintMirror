        "There is an elevator with the numbers from 1 to N. Each number goes up in the elevator and can go up as long as the concatenation of this number with the number of the floor (1 to N) is a multiple of the floor.",
        "Example, the number 1 reaches floor 2, because 11 is divisible by 1, 12 is divisible by 2, but it does not reach floor 3 because 13 is not divisible by 3.",
        "The sequence shows the numbers that can go higher in the elevator than the previous number.",
        "For example, 2 cannot go higher than 1, so it does not appear, instead number 3 can go up to floor 3, since 31 is divisible by 1, 32 is divisible by 2 and 33 is divisible by 3, instead I couldn't get to floor 4 because 34 is not divisible by 4."
