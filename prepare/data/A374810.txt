        "The two-player impartial {0,1}-Toggle game is played on a simple connected graph G where each vertex is assigned an initial weight of 0 or 1.",
        "A Toggle move consists of selecting a vertex v and switching its weight as well as the weight of each of its neighbors. This move is legal only provided the weight of vertex v is 1 and the total sum of the vertex weights decreases.",
        "In the special case G = P(k+2), a (1^k, 0, 1)-weight assignment is one in which vertex v(k+1) is assigned weight 0 and all remaining vertices are assigned weight 1."
