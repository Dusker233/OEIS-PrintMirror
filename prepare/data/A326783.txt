        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. A set-system is uniform if all edges have the same size.",
        "Alternatively, these are numbers whose binary indices all have the same binary weight, where the binary weight of a nonnegative integer is the numbers of 1's in its binary digits."
