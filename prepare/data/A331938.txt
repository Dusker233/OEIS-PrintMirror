        "A055932 lists numbers m whose prime divisors p are consecutive primes starting with 2, admitting multiplicity, while A002110 lists numbers m that are products of distinct consecutive primes starting with 2. Therefore, A002110 is a subset of A055932.",
        "Offset is 0 since A002110(0) = 1.",
        "Let 0 <= i <= k, integers. We can write an efficient algorithm to construct a complete list of all terms m of A055932 up to A002110(k) using A067255(m). Every term m in the list has omega(m) = A001221(m) <= k. Starting with A002110(i), we use A067255 to encode m, i.e., the list of multiplicities e pertaining to the 1st..i-th prime p_i, allowing position of the multiplicity e in the list to convey p_i. Thus, the first \"recipe\" for m = A002110(i) = {1, 1, ..., 1}, a list of i ones. If this does not exceed the limit A002110(k), then we accept it as a value, then increment the last multiplicity. When we have an invalid recipe, we increment the penultimate multiplicity and reset the last to 1, etc., until we have generated all m <= A002110(k). As a measure of efficiency, this algorithm generates 1 <= m <= A002110(12), 74469 terms, in about 2 seconds including sorting, on a 64-bit Intel Xeon E-2286M (2.40 GHz) processor. This is the same amount of time it takes to test numbers 1..400000 to yield the 575 smallest terms of the same sequence."
