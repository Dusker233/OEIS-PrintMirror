        "The sequence includes an infinite family of arithmetic progressions. Such AP's can be constructed to each term, with large differences [like e.g. square of primorials, A061742]. It is necessary to solve suitable systems of linear Diophantine equations. E.g.: subsequences of triples of terms = {900a+548, 900a+549, 900a+550}=4(225f+137), 9(100f+61), 25(36f+22)}; starting terms in this sequence = {549, 1458, 2358, ...}; difference = A002110(3)^2. - _Labos Elemer_, Nov 25 2002",
        "The numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k, for k = 1, 2, ..., are 0, 2, 16, 180, 1868, 18649, 186335, 1863390, 18634236, 186340191, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic density of this sequence exists and equals 0.01863... . - _Amiram Eldar_, Jan 18 2023"
