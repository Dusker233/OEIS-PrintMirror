        "Enumeration of the different triangulated planar polygons (TPP) on a base through hierarchic ear addition. An ear of a polygon is a triangle with two edges on the boundary. Start with a triangle on base 0, and number the two other edges 1 and 2 in counterclockwise direction. Add an ear on edge 1 or 2. The two different quadrilaterals on base 0 have now three other edges and we add a new ear on one of the renumbered edges 1, 2 or 3 but only where it forms a nonincreasing sequence with the preceding ear additions. We now have 1 and 2 for the two quadrilaterals and 11, 21, 22, 31, 32 for the five different pentagons. We can continue for the next polygons. Each generated number with v-3 digits stands for one triangulated planar polygon with v edges and vice versa and we don't have duplicates. However the decimal numbering limits the last generation to 98765432, for an 11-gon (4 <= v <= 11). The starting triangle (a degenerate TPP3) can also be seen as an ear addition on the base 0 (v >= 3)."
