        "The k-th digit must count the k-th nonnegative integer (A001477(k)) appearances in the term.",
        "This sequence is in base b=10. The number of appearances of any integer is always less than b in a term. E.g., the integer '0' can appear at most 9 times in a term.",
        "There are no further terms. This was verified with a computer search of all (permutations of) partitions of d = 1..90 using up to 9 of any digit 0..9 and all (permutations of) \"completions\" of the remaining d-10 digits consistent with these digit counts. It was verified in each of the two cases for counting appearances: without overlaps (1111 has 2 11's) and with overlaps allowed (1111 has 3 11's). - _Michael S. Branicky_, Dec 02 2022"
