        "For each k >= 1, 10^(4*k)-2*10^(3*k)+10^(2*k)-2*10^k+3 is a term.",
        "If k is a term and k-2 has length m, then all prime factors of 10^m+1 must be congruent to 1 or 3 (mod 8).  In particular, we can't have m == 2 (mod 4) or m == 3 (mod 6), as in those cases 10^m+1 would be divisible by 101 or 7 respectively. (End)"
