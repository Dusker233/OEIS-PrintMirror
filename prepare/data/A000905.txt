        "a(n) is the minimal degree of an equation from which n successive terms after the first can be removed (by a series of transformation comparable to Tschirnhaus') without requiring the solution of an equation of degree greater than n (and excluding cases where an equation of degree greater than n is needed but is in fact factorizable into several equations of degree all less than n). Hamilton computed the first six terms of this sequence (see reference). That is the reason Sylvester and Hammond named them \"Hamilton numbers\". - _Olivier G\u00e9rard_, Oct 17 2007",
