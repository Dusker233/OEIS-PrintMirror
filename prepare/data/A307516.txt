        "A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k), so these are Heinz numbers of integer partitions whose maximum and minimum parts differ by more than 1. The enumeration of these partitions by sum is given by A000094.",
