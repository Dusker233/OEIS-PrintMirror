        "Some confusion seems to exist in the distinction between n-snakes and n-coils. Earlier papers and also A000937 used \"snake\" to mean a closed path, which is called n-coil in newer notation, see Harary et al. a(8) is conjectured to be 97 by Rajan and Shende. [The true value, however, is 98. See Ostergard and Ville, 2014. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 06 2014]",
