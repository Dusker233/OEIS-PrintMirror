        "A number k does not have a strictly superior squarefree divisor if and only if k is at least as large as the square of rad(k), the largest squarefree divisor of k. All powerful numbers (A001694) have this property. This sequence lists the other such numbers.",
        "Let rad(k) = A007947(k), the largest squarefree divisor, i.e., the squarefree kernel of k. A341645 lists the numbers without a strictly superior squarefree divisor.",
        "A341645 = { k : rad(k) <= k/rad(k) } = { k : A007947(k) <= A003557(k) }, and it is evident that rad(k) <= k/rad(k) is true for powerful k, that is, k in A001694.",
        "Since A001694 contains A001597, the above is also true for perfect powers k; A001597 is a proper subset of A341645.",
        "This sequence contains \"weak\" k (in A052485) such that rad(k) < k/rad(k).",
        "The presence of a number, k, in this sequence depends only upon A290110(k), i.e., upon the factorization pattern of its sequence of divisors as defined in A191743.",
        "Let S = A006939 and let P = A002110. Almost all superprimorials are in this sequence: S \\ {1, 2, 12, 360} is a proper subset. S(i) = S(i-1)*P(i), where S(i-1) = A003557(S(i)) and P(i) = rad(S(i)), and for i > 4, S(i-1) > P(i). Since prime(i) | S(i) but prime(i)^2 does not divide S(i), S(i) is not powerful. Corollary: almost all superprimorials are in A341645, since this sequence is a proper subset of A341645."
