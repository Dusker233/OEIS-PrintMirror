        "Analogous to highly composite numbers (A002182) with number of exponential divisors (A049419) instead of number of divisors (A000005). The record numbers of exponential divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 54, 64, 72, 96, 108, 128, 144, 192, 216, 256, 288, 384, 432, ... The numbers have each exponent > 1. Proof: Suppose for some m, the exponent of prime p is 1. Then m/p has the same number of prime divisors hence m isn't a record. A contradiction hence all exponents are > 1.",
        "Terms have even exponents in A025487 in their prime factorization.",
        "Proof: Suppose some exponent e of a prime is not in A025487. Then there exists some term in A025487 number e1 < e that has the same number of divisors since e > 1. A contradiction hence all exponents are in A025487 and > 1.",
        "By the above discussion, the terms are squares with their square roots: 1,2,4,6,12,24,36,60,120,180,360,840,1260,2520,6300.",
