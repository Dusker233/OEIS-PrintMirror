        "Suggested by an email message from _Hugo van der Sanden_, Mar 23 2009, who says: Consider the partitions of a 2 x n rectangle into connected pieces consisting of unit squares cut along lattice lines. Then a(n) is the number of distinct pieces with rotational symmetry that extend to opposite corners.",
        "a(n+2) is the number of palindromic words of length n on a 3-letter alphabet {a,b,c} which do not contain the \"ab\" subword. See A001906 for the words of length n on a 3-letter alphabet without \"ab\" subword but not necessarily palindromic. Example length 1: \"a\" or \"b\" or \"c\". Example length 2: \"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\". Example length 3: There are 9 palindromic words but \"aba\" and \"bab\" are not admitted and only 7 remain. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 10 2019"
