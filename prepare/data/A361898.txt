        "A set of primes is called the covering set for the Sierpi\u0144ski number k if for every positive integer m there is at least one prime in the set which divides k*2^m + 1. Similarly, a set of primes is called the covering set for the Riesel number j if for every positive integer m there is at least one prime in the set which divides j*2^m - 1."
