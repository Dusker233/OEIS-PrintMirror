        "This is a companion sequence to A297447. The first two sign-changing zones were discovered by Bays and Hudson back in 1979. We discovered four additional zones starting from a(22794) = 5267226902633. The full sequence with all 6 zones checked up to 5*10^14 contains 664175 terms (see a-file) with a(664175) = 194318969449909 as its last term.",
        "This sequence was checked up to 10^15 and the 7th sign-changing zone starting from a(664176) = 930525161507057 and ending with a(850232)= 932080335660277 was found. - Andrey S. Shchebetov and _Sergei D. Shchebetov_, Jul 28 2018"
