        "The computation of the next two terms, corresponding to the primes F(131) = A005478(13) = 1066340417491710595814572169, and F(137) = A005478(14) = 19134702400093278081449423917, should already be within reach with current (2020) technology, e.g. with Kim Walisch's \"primecount\" program, which allows massive parallelization. An exact determination of the following term a(15), which corresponds to F(359), is beyond any imaginable technical possibility.",
