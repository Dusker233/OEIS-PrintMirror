        "Fink (2019) defined this sequence. He asked whether 720 is the largest term that is also superabundant number (A004394).",
        "He noted that up to 10^6 all the recursively superabundant numbers are also recursively highly composite numbers (A333952), except for 181440 (the next term which is not recursively highly composite is 2177280). He asked whether there are a finite number of numbers that are both recursively highly composite and recursively superabundant (in analogy to A166981).",
        "From _David A. Corneth_, Apr 13 2020: (Start)",
        "The 76 terms in the b-file are products of primorials (Cf. A025487) and 7-smooth numbers  (Cf. A002473). All terms are in A025487.",
        "Proof: As A330575(n) = Sum_{d|n} A074206(d) * n/d we have A330575(n) / n = Sum_{d|n} A074206(d)/d which is maximal for some prime signature when n is a product of primorials.",
