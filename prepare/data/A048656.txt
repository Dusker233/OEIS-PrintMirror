        "Let K(n) be the field that is generated over the rationals Q by adjoining the square roots of the numbers 1,2,3,...,n, i.e., K(n) = Q(sqrt(1),sqrt(2),...,sqrt(n)); a(n) is the degree of this field over Q. - Avi Peretz (njk(AT)netvision.net.il), Mar 20 2001",
        "For n>1, a(n) is the number of ways n! can be expressed as the product of two coprime integers p and q such that 0 < p/q < 1, if negative integers are considered as well. This is the answer to the 2nd problem of the International Mathematical Olympiad 2001. Example, for n = 3, the a(3) = 4 products are 3! = (-2)*(-3) = (-1)*(-6) = 1*6 = 2*3. - _Bernard Schott_, Jan 21 2021",
