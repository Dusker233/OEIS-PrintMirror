    "comment": [
        "Consider the lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative numbers that does not contain the arithmetic mean of any pair of terms (such sequences are called 3-free sequences as they do not contain 3-term arithmetic progressions): 0,1,3,4 and so on. This sequence is Stanley sequence S(0,1). Remove numbers in the Stanley sequence from nonnegative integers and repeat the process of finding the earliest 3-free sequence. The result is this sequence.",
        "When written in base three these are numbers that contain exactly one 2 that might be followed by zeros."

Our new sequence starts with 2,5,6. It can't contain 7 as 5,6,7 form an arithmetic progression. It can't contain 8 as 2,5,8 form an arithmetic progression. The next term is 11."
