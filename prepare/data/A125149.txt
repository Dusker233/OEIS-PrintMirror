    "comment": [
        "Unlike any of the prime number races in which any particular form may lead or trail, this sequence demonstrates that although the count of numbers having k prime factors begins by trailing the count for k-1 prime factors, eventually they exchange positions in the race. This can be seen by looking at A126279 or A126280.",
        "The fundamental theorem of arithmetic, or unique factorization theorem, states that every natural number greater than 1 either is itself a prime number, or can be written as a unique product of prime numbers. It had a proof sketched by Euclid, then corrected and completed in \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" [Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1801]. It fails in many rings of algebraic integers [Ernst Kummer, 1843], a discovery initiating algebraic number theory. Counting the elements in the unique product of prime numbers classifies natural numbers into primes, semiprimes, 3-almost primes and so on. This sequence quantifies a previously undescribed structure to that classification.",
        "We took the first k where the two relevant counts are the same. If instead we took the least k such that the n-almost prime count from k onwards exceeds the (n-1)-almost prime count, the sequence would begin: 3, 34, 15530, ... [see A180126].",
