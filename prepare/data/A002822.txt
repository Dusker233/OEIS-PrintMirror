        "Except for a(1)=1, all numbers in this sequence are congruent to (0, 2 or 3) mod 5.",
        "It appears that when a(n)=6j, then j is also in the sequence (e.g., 138 = 6*23; 312 = 6*52). This also appears to hold for sequence A191626. If true, then it suggests that when seeking large twin primes, good candidates might be 36*a(n) +- 1, n >= 2.",
        "Conjecture: There is at least one number in the sequence in the interval [5k, 7k] inclusive, k >= 1. If true, then the twin prime conjecture also is true.",

        "A counterexample to \"It appears that ...\": Take j = 63. Then 6j = 378 and 36j = 2268. Now 379, 2267, and 2269 are prime, but 377 = 13 * 29. The sequence of counterexamples is A263282. - _Jason Kimberley_, Oct 13 2015",
        "Dinculescu calls all terms in the sequence \"twin ranks\", and all other positive integers \"non-ranks\", see links. Non-ranks are given by the formula kp +- round(p/6) for positive integers k and primes p > 4, while twin ranks (this sequence) cannot be represented as kp +- round(p/6) for any k, p > 4. Here round(p/6) is the nearest integer to p/6. - _Alexei Kourbatov_, Jan 03 2015",

        "6m-1 and 6m+1 are twin primes iff 36m^2-1 is semiprime. It is algebraically provable that 36m^2-1 having any factor of the form 6k+-1 is equivalent to the statement that m is congruent to +-k (mod (6k+-1)). Other than the trivial case m=k, the fact of such a congruence means 36m^2-1 has a factor other than 6m-1 and 6m+1, and is not semiprime. Thus, {a(n)} lists the numbers m such that for all k < m, m is not congruent to +-k modulo (6k+-1). This is an alternative formulation of the results of Dinculescu referenced above. - _Keith Backman_, Apr 25 2021",
        "Other than a(1)=1, it is provable that a(n) is not a square unless it is a multiple of 5, and a(n) is not a cube unless it is a multiple of 7. Examples of the former include a(11)=5^2=25, a(26)=10^2=100, and a(166)=35^2=1225; examples of the latter are rarer, including a(1531)=28^3=21952 and a(4163)=42^3=74088. - _Keith Backman_, Jun 26 2021"
