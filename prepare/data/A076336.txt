    "comment": [
        "It is only a conjecture that this sequence is complete up to 3000000 - there may be missing terms.",
        "It is conjectured that 78557 is the smallest Sierpi\u0144ski number. - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 31 2003",
        "Sierpi\u0144ski numbers are proved by exhibiting a periodic sequence p of prime divisors with p(k) | n*2^k+1 and disproved by finding prime n*2^k+1. It is conjectured that numbers that cannot be proved Sierpi\u0144ski in this way are non-Sierpi\u0144ski. However, some numbers resist both proof and disproof. - _David W. Wilson_, Jan 17 2005",
        "Sierpi\u0144ski showed that this sequence is infinite.",
        "There are 4 related sequences that arise in this context:",
        "S1: Numbers n such that n*2^k + 1 is composite for all k (this sequence)",
        "S2: Odd numbers n such that 2^k + n is composite for all k (apparently it is conjectured that S1 and S2 are the same sequence)",
        "S3: Numbers n such that n*2^k + 1 is prime for all k (empty)",
        "S4: Numbers n such that 2^k + n is prime for all k (empty)",
        "The following argument, due to Michael Reid, attempts to show that S3 and S4 are empty: If p is a prime divisor of n + 1, then for k = p - 1, the term (either n*2^k + 1 or 2^k + n) is a multiple of p (and also > p, so not prime). [However, David McAfferty points that for the case S3, this argument fails if p is of the form 2^m-1. So it may only be a conjecture that the set S3 is empty. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 27 2021]",
        "a(1) = 78557 is also the smallest odd n for which either n^p*2^k + 1 or n^p + 2^k is composite for every k > 0 and every prime p greater than 3. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Oct 12 2015",
        "n = 4008735125781478102999926000625 = (A213353(1))^4 is in this sequence but is thought not to satisfy the conjecture mentioned by _David W. Wilson_ above. For this multiplier, all n*2^(4m + 2) + 1 are composite by an Aurifeuillean factorization. Only the remaining cases, n*2^k + 1 where k is not 2 modulo 4, are covered by a finite set of primes (namely {3, 17, 97, 241, 257, 673}). See Izotov link for details (although with another prime set). - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Apr 14 2018",
        "Conjecture: if S is a (provable) Sierpi\u0144ski number, then there exists a prime P such that S^p is also a Sierpi\u0144ski number for every prime p > P. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 12 2022",
        "Problem: are there odd numbers K such that K - 2^m is a Sierpi\u0144ski number for every 1 < 2^m < K? If so, then all positive values of (K - 2^m)*2^n + 1 are composite. Also, by the dual Sierpi\u0144ski conjecture, K - 2^m + 2^n is composite for every 1 < 2^m < K and for every n > 0. Note that, by the dual Sierpi\u0144ski conjecture, if p is an odd prime and 1 < 2^m < p, then there exists n such that (p - 2^m)*2^n + 1 is prime. So if such a number K exists, it must be composite. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 20 2022",
        "From _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 23 2022: (Start)",
        "1) The above Conjecture is true for Sierpi\u0144ski numbers provable by a \"covering set\", with P equal to the largest prime factor of the elements of that set*, according to the explanation from Michael Filaseta posted Jul 12 2022 on the SeqFan mailing list, cf. links. (*More generally: for S^p with any p coprime to all elements of the covering set, but not necessarily prime.)",
        "2) Wilson's comment from 2005 (also the first part, not only the conjecture) is misleading if not wrong because there are provable Sierpi\u0144ski numbers for which a covering set is not known (maybe even believed not to exist), as explained by Nielsen in his above comment from 2018. It should be clarified that (or: whether) \"provable\" in the definition of this sequence does not only mean \"through a covering set\". (End)"
