        "In a problem in the \"Bundeswettbewerb 2002\" competition there are 12 sticks of lengths 1,...,12 placed in a circle in random order. It has to be proved that there are at least 3 consecutive sticks with total length not less than 20. A closer look shows that the total length is at least a(12)=21. The problem of the contest is a consequence of the following observation: every term a(n) is at least ceiling(3*(n+1)/2), since n*a(n) >= Sum_{i=1..n} (p(i-1)+p(i)+p(i+1)) = 3*Sum_{i=1..n} i = 3*n*(n+1)/2. So in the case n=12 we have (total length) >= a(12)=21 >= 20.",
