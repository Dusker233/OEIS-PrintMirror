        "If the qualifying condition in the previous paragraph was based on the rows instead of the columns of A329050, we would get A055932. The self-inverse function defined by A225546 transposes A329050. A225546 also has multiplicative properties such that if we consider A055932 and this sequence as sets, A225546(.) maps the members of either set 1:1 onto the other set."
