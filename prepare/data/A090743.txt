        "No further terms below 5456. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Feb 18 2004",
        "Approximately 1/3rd of numbers of the form described in the definition have a digit sum which is a multiple of 3 and therefore they are not prime numbers and do not have to be otherwise tested for prime status. The indices (i.e., integer lengths) of the first few such numbers are 3, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 56, 57, . . . Those indices appear to satisfy a linear recurrence having signature (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1) and can also be derived from the expansion of g.f. = (3+8*x+x^2+2*x^3+x^4)/((-1+x)^2*(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4)). - _Harvey P. Dale_, Dec 02 2018"
