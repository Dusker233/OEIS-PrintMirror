        "All the palindromic numbers with an even number of digits are divisible by 11. The number of palindromic numbers with 2*k+1 digits that are divisible by 11 is (10^(k+1) + (-1)^k)/11, and their asymptotic relative density within the set of all palindromic numbers with an odd number of digits (A056525) is 1/11 (Schmidt, 1988). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jan 11 2021"
