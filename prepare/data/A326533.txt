        "These are numbers where each prime index has a different Omega (number of prime factors counted with multiplicity). A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. The multiset multisystem with MM-number n is obtained by taking the multiset of prime indices of each prime index of n. For example, the prime indices of 78 are {1,2,6}, so the multiset multisystem with MM-number 78 is {{},{1},{1,2}}."
