    "comment": [
        "Because it is possible to generate triangles using three consecutive odd primes (see A096377) any four consecutive primes will form a quadrilateral. If such quadrilaterals are configured to be cyclic they will have maximal area. This sequence comprises the integer part of these maximal areas.",
        "Proof: Given 4 consecutive odd primes a, b, c, d with a < b < c < d we only have to prove that a+b+c > d for a quadrilateral to exist. However we know that 3 consecutive odd primes will form a triangle hence a+b > c and a+b+c > 2c and by Bertrand's postulate there exists a prime d such that c < d < 2c so a+b+c > d. By induction this can be extended such that n consecutive primes will always form an n-gon."
