        "An ancestral configuration is a set of gene lineages present immediately before a node of a species tree is reached, looking backward in time, and a root ancestral configuration is an ancestral configuration at the root node. The term a(n) gives the largest number of root ancestral configurations among pairs (G,S) where G is a labeled gene tree topology, S is a bijectively labeled species tree topology, G and S have n leaves, and G=S."
