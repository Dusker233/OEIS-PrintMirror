        "Letting t = m^k, this sequence consists of the integers k for which there exists some integer m such that s(t) = m + k, where s(t) = A007953(t) represents the sum of digits of t. Rearranging gives m = t^(1/k) = s(t) - k; this allows you to find numbers which follow a common online trick like 64^(1/2) = (6 + 4) - 2 or 216^(1/3) = (2 + 1 + 6) - 3. This online trick was the original motivation for this sequence."
