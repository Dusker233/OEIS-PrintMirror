        "The numbers 2^2^n-1 for n=0,1,...,5 are in the sequence because 2^2^n-1=(2^2^0+1)*(2^2^1+1)*(2^2^2+1)*...*(2^2^(n-1)+1); 2^2^k+1 for k=0,1,2,3 & 4 are primes (Fermat primes); sigma(2^k)=2^(k+1)-1 and phi is a multiplicative function. Hence if p is a known Fermat prime (p=2^2^n+1 for n=0,1,2,3 & 4) then p-2 is in the sequence, note that this is not true for unknown Fermat primes if they exist. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 27 2004"
