        "a(n) is number of ways to place 3 queens on an (n+1) X (n+1) chessboard so that they diagonally attack each other exactly 3 times. The maximal possible attack number, p=binomial(k,2)=3 for k=3 queens, is achievable only when all queens are on the same diagonal. In graph-theory representation they thus form the corresponding complete graph. - _Antal Pinter_, Dec 27 2015",
