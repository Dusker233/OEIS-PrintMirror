    "comment": [
        "Similar to A067855, but with the elementary symmetric function instead of the Schur function. Note that A067855 describes (s_lambda)^2 which equals the count for (s_lambda . s_lambda'). This is not the case for the other symmetric functions. Squared length of sum of (e_lambda)^2 is simply A000041 (the partition numbers).",
        "The result is identical for the homogenous and the power sum symmetric functions h_lambda and p_lambda since all three can be written as products: e_lambda = Product_{i=1..n} e(lambda_i)."
