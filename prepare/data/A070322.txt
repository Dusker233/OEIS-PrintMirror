        "An n X n nonnegative matrix A is primitive iff every element of A^k is > 0 for some power k. If A is primitive then the power which should have all positive entries is <= n^2 - 2n + 2 (Wielandt).",
        "Equivalently, a(n) is the number of n X n Boolean relation matrices that converge in their powers to U, the all 1's matrix. From the Rosenblatt reference we know that the relations that converge to U are precisely those that are strongly connected and whose cycle lengths have gcd equal to 1. In particular, if a strongly connected relation has at least one self loop then it converges to U. So A003030(n)*(2^n - 1) < a(n) < A003030(n)*2^n. Almost all (0,1)-matrices are primitive. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Jul 20 2022"
