        "Take the decimal number formed by the first n digits of A023396 in reverse order and divide by 2^n.",
        "The sequence A053312 gives n-digit numbers consisting entirely of 1s and 2s which are divisible by 2^n. The quotients upon division form the present sequence. The parity of the n-th term here determines the next term in A023396; if odd, it is a 1 and if even, a 2.",
