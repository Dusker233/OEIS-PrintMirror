        "It seems that, starting with a(2), this is row j = 1 in Table 3 (p. 176) in Wang et al. (2003). This is also corroborated by the title of the table: \"The numbers f_{ij} of stereo isomers of acyclic saturated compounds consisting of C, O, and H, C_i H_{2i+2} O_j\". Such a claim, if true, can probably be proved by using Eqs. (5), (6), and (7) on pp. 175-176 of the paper. - _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 24 2019"
