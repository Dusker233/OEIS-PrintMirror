        "In music, these are known as harmonics.",
        "Observe that log_2(n) produces irrational numbers for all n that are not powers of 2, and that dividing a string in half produces an octave interval.",
        "Therefore the only harmonics that are perfectly in tune (equal to an interval in 12-TET) are the octaves, which correspond to all harmonics n that are powers of 2."
