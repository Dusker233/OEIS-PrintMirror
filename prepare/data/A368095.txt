        "A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets. The weight of a set-system is the sum of cardinalities of its elements.",
        "The axiom of choice says that, given any set of nonempty sets Y, it is possible to choose a set containing an element from each. The strict version requires this set to have the same cardinality as Y, meaning no element is chosen more than once."
