    "formula": [
        "If N = q^k*n^2 is an odd perfect number with special prime q, then it is easy to show that sigma(n^2)/q^k = 2n^2/sigma(q^k) = gcd(n^2,sigma(n^2)).  From the last equation, it is easy to prove that D(n^2)/s(q^k) = 2s(n^2)/D(q^k) = gcd(n^2,sigma(n^2)), where D(x)=2x-sigma(x) is the deficiency of x and s(x)=sigma(x)-x is the sum of the aliquot divisors of x.",
        "Note that, if k = 1, then sigma(q^k) < n, from which it would follow that q^k < n.  [See (Dris, 2017).]  Therefore, if k = 1, we have that N = q^k n^2 < n^3.  Using Ochem and Rao's lower bound for an odd perfect number, we get n^3 > N > 10^1500, from which we obtain n > 10^500. [See (Ochem and Rao, 2012).]",
        "Thus, if k = 1, we have the lower bound sigma(n^2)/q^k = 2n^2/sigma(q^k) = gcd(n^2, sigma(n^2)) > 2n > n > 10^500 which significantly improves on the corresponding result in (Chen and Chen, 2014).",
