        "The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [RED ; NEUTRAL ; BLUE], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the presented sequence is NOT optimal. The particular \"75\" algorithm solving the puzzle at hand is presented in a paper referenced by link 1 listed below. For the optimal solution of the Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the given pre-coloring configuration see A183113 and A183114. Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",
