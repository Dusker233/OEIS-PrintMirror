    "comment": [
        "Dodecahedra and icosahedra with integer coordinates cannot be formed in Euclidean space (of any dimension) because pentagons with integer coordinates cannot be formed in Euclidean space, and both polyhedra contain a subset of vertices that form a pentagon. Therefore, this sequence counts the regular tetrahedra, cubes, and octahedra in the bounded cubic lattice."
