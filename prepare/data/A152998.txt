        "On the semi-infinite square grid, at stage 0, we start from a vertical half toothpick at [(0,0),(0,1)]. This half toothpick represents one of the two components of the first toothpick placed in the toothpick structure of A139250. Consider only the toothpicks of length 2, so a(0) = 0.",
        "At stage 1, we place an orthogonal toothpick of length 2 centered at the end, so a(1) = 1.",
        "In each subsequent stage, for every exposed toothpick end, place an orthogonal toothpick centered at that end.",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n stages. A152968 (the first differences) gives the number of toothpicks added to the structure at n-th stage.",
