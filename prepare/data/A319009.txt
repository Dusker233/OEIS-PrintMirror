        "Write k as k = Product_{i=1..t} (p_i)^(e_i) where p_i are distinct primes. If (p_i)^(e_i) belongs to A167791 (and thus here) for 1 <= i <= t, then k is also here, but the converse is not true. In fact, this sequence has terms such that none of (p_i)^(e_i) belongs to A167791, the smallest of which is 301 = 7*43. The multiplicative order of 2 modulo 7 and 43 are 3 (< psi(7) = 6) and 14 (< psi(43) = 42), so the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 301 is lcm(3, 14) = 42 = psi(301)."
