        "5 is not a term. Sigma[5]=6, and both 6-1=5 and 6+1=7 are primes. Phi[5]=4, and both 4-1=3 and 4+1=5 are primes. But, even though (3,5) and (5,7) are in some sense \"(different) twin prime pairs\" (quoting the sequence's definition), because 5 is a member of both they are treated, for purposes of this sequence, as not being \"different.\" - _Harvey P.
