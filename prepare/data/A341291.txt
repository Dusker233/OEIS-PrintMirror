        "There is a unique way to tile the first quadrant with L-tiles and backward-L tiles. Upside down-L's are not allowed.",
        "Consider the graph formed by the 1-skeleton of the tiling, with nodes at points of degree 3 or 4. The sequence gives the number of nodes at distance 0 from the node at the origin.",

        "Build the tiling row by row, from bottom to top, left to right.",
        "When you fill a row, you must keep the row above tileable. Since all the tiles have a length-2 base, any unfilled part of a row with no spaces underneath it is only tileable if it has even length.",
        "When you place a tile, its stalk protrudes into the row above, and only one choice of the tile makes the unfilled part to the left of the stalk have even length. (End)",
