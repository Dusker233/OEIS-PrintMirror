        "The omega-sequence of an integer partition is the sequence of lengths of the multisets obtained by repeatedly taking the multiset of multiplicities until a singleton is reached. For example, the partition (32211) has chain of multisets of multiplicities {1,1,2,2,3} -> {1,2,2} -> {1,2} -> {1,1} -> {2}, so its omega-sequence is (5,3,2,2,1) with sum 13.",
