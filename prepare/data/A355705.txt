        "Because asymptotically size of partitions number function p(n) ~ O(exp(sqrt(n))), and probability of primality of p(n) ~ O(1/sqrt(n)) and combined probability of primality of p(n) and p(n)+-2 is ~ O(1/n), the sum of the prime probabilities is diverging and there are no obvious restrictions on primality; therefore, this sequence may be conjectured to be infinite.",
