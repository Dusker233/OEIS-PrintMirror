        "The sequence results from some interesting combinatorics that come from the interaction of",
        "1) the quotient rule,",
        "2) the derivative recurrence relation for Bessel functions, and",
        "3) the fact that J_n(0) = 0 unless n = 0 and J_0(0) = 1.",
        "At each stage the numerator is the sum of products of Bessel functions. Each derivative introduces new terms which also (by the Bessel derivative recurrence relation) increment or decrement the Bessel function orders in the terms of the numerator. a(n) is the coefficient in front of the term (J_0(x))^(2^n) (if it exists). There are complicated combinatorics involved in what contributes to that coefficient."
