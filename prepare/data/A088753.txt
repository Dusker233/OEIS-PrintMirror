        "Although the starting number n is regarded as part of the trajectory, it is allowed to be palindromic. Hence palindromes are not excluded from the sequence. A063048 is obtained if palindromes are excluded. The smallest term in A088753 but not in A063048 is 9999, the smallest term in A063048 but not in A088753 is 19098.",

        "From _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 13 2019: (Start)",
        "Lychrel numbers listed here are also called \"seeds\", in contrast to Kin numbers A023108 which include all terms in the orbits of the former.",
        "It is not easy to determine whether the orbit of a given term will never merge into the orbit of an earlier term. It seems that the property of \"disjoint orbit\" is as conjectural as the property of not reaching a palindrome. One could specify a \"search limit\" in order to get a well-defined sequence. The given list of terms has been checked and extended by considering the orbits up to members of size <= 10^199 at least. Given that the number increases by a factor 10 roughly every 2.416 iterations, this corresponds to about 500 iterations. (End)"
