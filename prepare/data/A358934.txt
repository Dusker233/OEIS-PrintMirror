        "a(n) is the number of edge covers of a spider graph with five branches where each branch has n vertices besides the center vertex. The idea is each branch is treated as a path P_(n+2). Each branch acts independently then and has F_(n+1) covers (P_n has F(n-1) covers), hence F_(n+1)^5 total. Except we remove the cases where each branch is missing the connecting edge to the center, which is when that edge cover comes from P_n , hence the minus F_(n-1)^5.",
