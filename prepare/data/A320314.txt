        "A domino tower is a stack of bricks, where (1) each row is offset from the preceding row by half of a brick, (2) the bottom row is contiguous, and (3) each brick is supported from below by at least half of a brick.",
        "The number of (not necessarily symmetric) domino towers with n blocks is given by 3^(n-1).",
        "a(n) is odd for all n.",
        "The not necessarily symmetric case is described in the Miklos Bona reference. Similar considerations lead to a decomposition of symmetric towers into half pyramids which are enumerated by the Motzkin numbers. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 12 2021"
