    "comment": [
        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every finite set of finite nonempty sets has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18.",
        "Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges. In an antichain, no edge is a subset or superset of any other edge. In a 2-vertex-connected set-system, at least two vertices must be removed to make the set-system disconnected. A blob is a connected, 2-vertex-connected antichain of finite, nonempty sets, or, equivalently, a 2-vertex-connected clutter."
