        "Florian Luca proved that this sequence is infinite, by showing that 37*x(7*k) + 98*y(7*k) is in the sequence, where x(k) = A001081(k) and y(k) = A001080(k) are solutions of the Pell equation x^2 - 7*y^2 = 1. The sequence of these numbers is 37, 9667939010, 2524807950507510523, 659360302164952911361460078, ... - _Amiram Eldar_, Aug 22 2018",
