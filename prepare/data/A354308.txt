        "A polyjog is a polyform composed of n connected unit squares adjoined along half-edges: every pair of adjacent cells shares an edge of length exactly 1/2. The polyjogs of order n form a subset of polyominoes of order 4n.",
        "Figures that differ by a rotation or reflection are considered equivalent.",
        "It is not hard to prove that every polyjog can be tiled by unit squares in exactly one way. Therefore, equivalences involving internal rearrangement of unit squares are not relevant (unlike related sequences; cf. A216583)."
