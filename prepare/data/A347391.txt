If m (the parent of x, x = A003961(m), m = A064989(x)) is even, then x is a multiple of 3, while if m is odd, then 3 does not divide x. Because the abundancy index decreases when traversing leftwards in the Doudna tree, m must be a term of A068403. Both x and m would also need to be squares, by necessity.",
