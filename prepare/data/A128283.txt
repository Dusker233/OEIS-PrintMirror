        "The symmetric representation of sigma (A237593) for p1*p2, SRS(p1*p2), consists of either 4 or 3 regions. Let p1 < p2. Then 2*p1 < p2 implies that SRS(p1*p2), consists of 2 pairs of regions of widths 1 having respective sizes (p1*p2 + 1)/2 and (p1 + p2)/2; and p2 < 2*p1 implies that SRS(p1*p2) consists of 2 outer regions of width 1 and size (p1*p2 + 1)/2 and a central region of maximum width 2 of size p1 + p2 . Therefore, if SRS(p1*p2) has four regions, the area of each is a prime number (see A233562) and if it has three regions, the central area is an even semiprime (A100484). - _Hartmut F. W.
