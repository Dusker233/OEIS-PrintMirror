        "An achiral coloring is identical to its reflection. The Schl\u00e4fli symbols for the tesseract and the hyperoctahedron are {4,3,3} and {3,3,4} respectively. Both figures are regular 4-D polyhedra and they are mutually dual. There are 192 elements in the automorphism group of the tesseract that are not in its rotation group. Each involves a permutation of the axes that can be associated with a partition of 4 based on the conjugacy class of the permutation. This table shows the hyperoctahedron facet (tesseract vertex) cycle indices for each member of such a class. The first formula is obtained by averaging these cycle indices after replacing x_i^j with n^j according to the P\u00f3lya enumeration theorem.",
