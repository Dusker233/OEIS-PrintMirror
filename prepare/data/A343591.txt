        "Equivalently, numbers that are primes, smoothly undulating = in which the digits alternate: ababab... with a <> b (A032758) and alternating = in which parity of the digits alternates (A030144).",
        "Charles W. Trigg was the first to use the word 'smoothly' for these integers.",
        "If we note a(ba) the terms where the substring (ba) is repeated in their decimal expansion, there exist only 16 possibilities with a odd <> 5 and b even <> 0 to get such primes. Indeed, there exist primes of the form 1(21), 1(41), 1(61), 1(81), 3(23), 3(83), 7(27), 7(47), 7(87), 9(29), 9(49), 9(89). There do not exist terms of the form 3(63), 7(67), 9(69), as they are always composite.",
        "Now, what about possible terms of the form 3(43)? If (43) is repeated 3k times, 3(43) is divisible by 3; if (43) is repeated 3k+1 times, 3(43) is divisible by 7; so if such a prime exists, then the substring (43) must be repeated 3k+2 times, but it is not known if such smoothly undulating prime 3(43) exists and if it exists, (43) must be repeated at least 9302 times, so k >= 3100 (link).",
