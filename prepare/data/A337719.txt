Reflection about the x-axis is valid because absolute differences are maintained. Note that it is not possible for a solution to be equivalent to any of its own transformations. If it were, the base layer or the layer that succeeds it would need to be palindromic. This is invalid because any absolute-difference triangle with a palindromic base and a height greater than one is topped with a zero."
