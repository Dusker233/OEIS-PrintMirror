        "If A007088(n) (the binary expansion of n) contains a string of k zeros, then it contains A007088(2^m), where 0 <= m <= k, as a substring. Similarly, if A007088(n) contains a string of k ones, then it contains A007088(2^m - 1), where 1 <= m <= k. Strings of zeros and ones are the most compact way to have powers of 2 and powers of 2 minus 1 (respectively) as substrings in a binary expansion. This means that A007088(a(n)) will contain a string of A000523(n) ones and a string of A000523(n) zeros. The binary expansion of a(2^k - 1) will contain a string of k ones and a string of k - 1 zeros.",
        "Conjecture: a(n) == 0 (mod A053644(n)), i.e., A007088(a(n)) ends with the longest string of zeros. It follows from this that a(2^k) = 2*a(2^k - 1). A conjecture related to this is that a(2^k - 1) = 2*a(2^k - 2) + 2^(k - 1), i.e., A007088(a(2^k - 1)) ends with the longest string of ones followed by the longest string of zeros. Ending with the longest string of ones followed by the longest string of zeros is not true for all A007088(a(n)), as some have a hiccup before starting their string of zeros, e.g., a(10), a(18), a(22), and a(34).",
        "Conjecture: a(2^k + 1) = 2^(k + floor(log_2(a(2^k)))) + a(2^k), i.e., concatenate the binary expansion of 2^(k - 1) to the front of the binary expansion of a(2^k) in order to get the binary expansion of a(2^k + 1).",

        "For a proof that a(n) == 2^floor(log_2(n)) (mod 2^(floor(log_2(n)) + 1)), see my second link (not the b-file). This also proves the conjecture from May 09 2021 which states that it is congruent to 0 (mod A053644(n)). A proof for the related conjecture would likely rely on an explanation of values of n such that a(n) is not congruent to (2^floor(log_2(n)) - 1)*2^floor(log_2(n)) (mod 2^(2*floor(log_2(n)))), i.e. the values of n such that A007088(a(n)) does not end with a string of floor(log_2(n)) ones followed immediately by a string of floor(log_2(n)) zeros. A proof for Jon E. Schoenfield's second conjecture on Jun 03 2021 would satisfy my more restricted second conjecture and it may follow necessarily from my proof, assuming that A007088(a(n)) must begin with either A007088(2^floor(log_2(n - 1)) + 1) or A007088(2^floor(log_2(n))).
