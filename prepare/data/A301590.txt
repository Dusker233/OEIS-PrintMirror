        "In the definition, A023900(p) = 1-p. One has sign(A023900(n)) = (-1)^A001221(n), so a different solution x can only exist if x has at least 3 distinct prime factors. The smallest number of the form p*q*r such that (p-1)*(q-1)*(r-1) = P-1 for primes p, q, r, P is 2*3*7 = 42, eliminating P = 13 = A301591(1) from this sequence. This is the case whenever (P+1)/2 = p > 3 is a prime (in A005382), whence P-1 = (2-1)*(3-1)*(p-1), which eliminates all P > 5 in A005383 from this sequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 14 2021"
