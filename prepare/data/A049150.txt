        "In A049150 to A049170 Gerard defines the \"recip\" transform as a mix of sign reversals, shifts and the series revert transformation: the recip transform of g(x), a rational ordinary function, defines a sequence of +1 and -1, summarized in the comments as a sequence of signs. Then each second of these signs is flipped, equivalent to the substitution x->(-x) in the generating function. The offset is increased by 1, equivalent to multiplication of the generating function by x. The usual series reversion (see the standard definitions) of a power series x+O(x^2) is applied, the result is divided by x (i.e,. the offset is changed from 1 back to 0) and again the sign of each 2nd term is flipped (equivalent to x->-x in the final o.g.f.). - _R.
