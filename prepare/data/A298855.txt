        "All numbers in this sequence are odd since the symmetric representation of 2*p, p prime > 3, has two parts each of size 3*(p+1)/2, and that for 6 has one part of size 12.",
        "A number in this sequence has the form p*q, p and q prime, 3 <= p and 2*p < q, since in this case 2*p <= floor((sqrt(8*p*q + 1) - 1)/2) < q so that 1's in row p*q of A237048 occur only in positions 1, 2, p and 2*p.",
        "This sequence is a subsequence of A046388, hence of A006881, as well as of A174905, A241008 and A280107.",
        "The two central parts of the symmetric representation of sigma(p*q), each of size (p+q)/2, meet on the diagonal when q = 2*p + 1 since in this case 2*p = floor((sqrt(8*p*q + 1) - 1)/2). These triangular numbers p*(2p+1) form sequence A156592, except for its first element 10, and form a subsequence of the diagonal in the associated irregular triangle of this sequence given in the Example section. They also are a subsequence of A264104. A function to compute the coordinates on the diagonal where the two central parts meet is defined in sequence A240542.",
