        "For squarefree numbers k, csigma(k) = k, where csigma(k) is the sum of the coreful divisors of k (A057723). Thus, if m is a term (csigma(m) > 2*m) and k is a squarefree number coprime to k, then csigma(k*m) = csigma(k) * csigma(m) = k * csigma(m) > 2*k*m, so k*m is a coreful abundant number. Therefore, the sequence of coreful abundant numbers (A308053) can be generated from this sequence by multiplying with coprime squarefree numbers. The asymptotic density of the coreful abundant numbers can be calculated from this sequence (see comment in A308053)."
