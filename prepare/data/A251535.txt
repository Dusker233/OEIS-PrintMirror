        "For a given n>0, imagine a continuously-running wall clock that chimes once every a(n) minutes. Let m equal the number of distinct minute marks the minute hand would point to over the course of time at each chime. This sequence defines the values of a(n) for m=20. An example of this sequence is depicted in Battlestar Galactica Season 1 Episode 1 \"33\" (from 2004) with a(5)=33. - _David Martin_, Nov 26 2019"
