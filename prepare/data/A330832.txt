        "Also numbers with power-spectral basis {q,p^k}. The equation q=(p^k-1)/(p-1) is equivalent to the decomposition of the identity q + p^k = pq + 1 in Z/pqZ, and it is now easily verified that {q,p^k} is the spectral basis of p*q, consisting of primes and powers.",
        "The numbers p^(r^e)*q, where p, q, r are primes, and q=(p^(r^e)-1)/(p^(r^(e-1))-1), e>0, have power-spectral basis {q,p^(r^e)}. However, the primes q for e>1 are usually quite large, while e=1 is accessible. For example, the table in A003424 has 4738 entries with all primes q<10^12, but only 8 have y>1."
