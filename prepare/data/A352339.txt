        "There are 2 well-established systems of giving every nonnegative integer a unique representation as a sum of positive Pell numbers (A000129), 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, ...: the minimal (or greedy) representation (A317204) in which any occurrence of the digit 2 is succeeded by a 0 (i.e., if a Pell number appears twice in the sum, its preceding term in the Pell sequence does not appear), and the maximal (or lazy) representation of n in which any occurrence of the digit 0 is succeeded by a 2 (i.e., if a Pell number does not appear in the sum, its preceding term in the Pell sequence appears twice).
