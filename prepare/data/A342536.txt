        "For any polygon, build a bracelet of black and white beads by following the border of the polygon in a clockwise direction, adding a black bead for each right-turning right angle, and a white bead for each left-turning right angle. The polygons counted by this sequence are those whose bracelets have all the black beads together and all the white beads together."
