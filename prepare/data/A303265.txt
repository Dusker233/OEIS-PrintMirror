        "A300565(1) = 32 is the smallest z such that z^5 = x^3 + y^4 for some x, y > 1, and the smallest such y is a(1) = 64. It then follows that x = (32^5 - 64^4)^(1/3) = (2^24)^(1/3) = 256.",
        "A300565(2) = 250 is the second smallest z such that z^5 = x^3 + y^4 for some x, y > 1, and the smallest corresponding y is a(2) = 625. It then follows that x = (250^5 - 625^4)^(1/3) = 9375.",
        "A300565(3) = 1944 is the next larger z such that z^5 = x^3 + y^4 for some x, y > 1, and the smallest corresponding y is a(2) = 11664. It then follows that x = (1944^5 - 11664^4)^(1/3) = 209952."
