        "If 113 is, as conjectured, the last term of A124129, then P(a(n)) = A158939(n+2). Proof: Let x and y be the prime gaps following the prime p = P(j) > 113, so that P(j+1) = P(j) + x and P(j+2) = P(j) + x + y. The inequality P(j)/P(j+1) > P(j+1)/P(j+2) can be written as p/(p+x) > (p+x)/(p+x+y), which simplifies to y > x+x^2/p. By assumption, x^2 < p, so this holds if and only if y > x. So the condition P(j)/P(j+1) > P(j+1)/P(j+2) is equivalent to increasing prime gaps, P(j+2) - P(j+1) > P(j+1) - P(j). (In fact, since all prime gaps except the first are even, it is enough to assume the weaker conjecture that 7 is the only prime P(j) such that (P(j+1)-P(j))^2 >= 2*P(j).) - _Pontus von Br\u00f6mssen_, Nov 19 2021"
