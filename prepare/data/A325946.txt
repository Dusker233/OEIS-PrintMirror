The relative difference between M_O(n) and 2*(2n-2*ceiling(sqrt(n))) is less than 3% for at least 145 <= n <= 10^7 tiles and the relative difference goes to zero.

        "Moreover, we believe all of the intermediary cases are generated by a family of archetypes where one moves from a regular octagon to a \"stretched octagon\" to a \"small corners octagon\" and then to the next largest regular octagon.
