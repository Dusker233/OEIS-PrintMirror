        "Write k = 2^{e_0} * Product_{j=1..r} (p_j)^(e_j), then k is a term if and only if e_0 <= 2, and ord(3,(p_j)^(e_j)) is 2 times a power of 3 for every 1 <= j <= r, where ord(a,k) is the multiplicative order of a modulo k: 3^3^i == -1 (mod k) if and only if 3^3^i == -1 (mod 2^{e_0}), and 3^3^i == -1 (mod (p_j)^(e_j)) for every 1 <= j <= r. This is in turn equivalent to e_0 <= 2, and ord(3,(p_j)^(e_j)) being even, and 3^i == ord(3,(p_j)^(e_j))/2 (mod ord(3,(p_j)^(e_j))) for every 1 <= j <= r. As a result, such i exists if and only if e_0 <= 2, and ord(3,(p_j)^(e_j)) is 2 times a power of 3 for every 1 <= j <= r. In other words, each term is a product of a number in {1,2,4} and odd prime powers q such that ord(3,q) is 2 times a power of 3.",
