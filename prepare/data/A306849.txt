        "As for Sophie Germain primes which are Brazilian (A306845), these terms are relatively rare (only 28 terms < 10^15).",
        "The first 26051 terms of this sequence are of the form (11111)_b. The successive bases b are 7, 28, 40, 94, 118, 292, 373, 490, 604, 679, 1108, 1183, ... These 26051 terms end in 1: If base b ends in 1 or 6, (11111)_b ends in 5 and cannot be prime; if base b ends in another digit, then (11111)_b always ends in 1.",
        "The first term which is not of this form has 31 digits; it's 1425663266336265377189900884061 = 1 + 1036 + ... + 1036^9 + 1036^10 = (11111111111)_1036 with a string of eleven 1's. In this case, the successive bases are 1036, 2089, 6961, 7894, 9775, ...",
        "If (b^q - 1)/(b - 1) is a term, necessarily q (prime) == 5 (mod 6) and b == 1 (mod 3). The smallest term for each pair (q,b) is (5,7), (11,1036), (17,1603), (23,6697), (29,2779), (41,26719), (47,98506), (53,2110)."
