        "Let m >= 1. The sequence of hypergraph Catalan numbers {C_m(n): n >= 0} is defined in terms of counting walks on trees, weighted by the orders of their automorphism groups. When m = 1 we get the sequence of Catalan numbers A000108. The present sequence is the case m = 2.",
        "Let T(n) be the set of unlabeled trees on n vertices (see A000055). Let T \u2208 T(n+1), and let v  be a vertex of T. Then an a(m,T)-tour beginning at v is a walk that begins and ends at v and traverses each edge of T exactly 2*m times. We denote by a(m,T)(v) the number of a(m,T)-tours beginning at v.",
        "The hypergraph Catalan numbers C_m(n) are defined by C_m(n) = Sum_{trees T in T(n+1)} Sum_{vertices v in T} a(m,T)(v)/|Aut(T)|, where Aut(T) denotes the automorphism group of the tree T.",
