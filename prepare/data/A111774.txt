        "In this sequence there are no (odd) primes and there are no powers of 2.",
        "So we have only three kinds of natural numbers: the odd primes, the powers of 2 and the numbers that can be represented as a sum of at least three consecutive integers.",

        "From _Ralf Steiner_, Jul 09 2019: (Start)",
        "If k >= 1 sequences are c_k(n) = c_k(n - 1) + n + k - 1, c_k(0) = 0, means c_k(n) = n*(n + 2*k - 1)/2: A000217, A000096, A055998, A055999, A056000, ... then this sequence is the union of c_k(n), n >= 3. (End)",
        "From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 28 2020: (Start)",
        "This sequence gives all positive integers that have at least one odd prime as proper divisor. The proof follows from the first two comments.",
        "The set {a(n)}_{n>=1} equals the set {k positive integer : floor(k/2) - delta(k) >= 1}, where delta(k) = A055034(k). Proof: floor(k/2) gives the number of positive odd numbers < k, and delta(k), gives the number of positive odd numbers coprime to k. delta(1) = 1 but 1 is not < 1, therefore k = 1 is not a member of this set. Hence a member >= 2 of this set has at least one odd number > 1 and < k missing in the set of odd numbers relative prime to k. Therefore there exists at least one odd prime < k dividing k. (End)",

So for example, 4+5+6+7 = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7-1-2-3 = 22, which is (x*(x+1)-y*(y+1))/2 when x=7, y=3. Notice that values can appear more than once in the array because some numbers can be represented as sums of more than one string of three or more consecutive positive integers. For example, 30 = (x*(x+1)-y*(y+1))/2 when (a) x=11, y=8: 9+10+11; (b) x=9, y=5: 6+7+8+9; and (c) x=8, y=3: 4+5+6+7+8. By definition, x-y is the number of integers in the string. (End)"
