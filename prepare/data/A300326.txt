        "For primes 5 <= p <= 23, a(n) (mod p) is p(p-1) periodic. I conjecture this to hold for all p >= 5.",
        "It also appears that the last 4 terms of these periods are (1, 1, 0, 0) (mod p), for any p >= 2, i.e., a(n) is divisible by p at least for k*P-2 <= n <= k*P for any k >= 0, where P is the period length p(p-1) (resp. 8 or 9 for p = 2 and 3).",
        "These properties might allow a proof that a(1..4) are the only primes. However, a(12) = 14231491*21776141, so there is little hope of finding a reasonably sized finite covering set.",

The partial sums for those terms are 0, 2, 23, 251, 3181, and 47971; after 0, the following 4 sums are primes, but 47971 is not prime. The same is true for subsequent partial sums, whence the conjecture in COMMENTS."
