        "We define the n-th standard ordered rooted tree to be obtained by taking the (n-1)-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) as root and replacing each part with its own standard ordered rooted tree. This ranking is an ordered variation of Matula-Goebel numbers, giving a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled ordered rooted trees."
