    "comment": [
        "Hardy and Subbarao defined a coreful divisor d of a number k as a divisor with the same set of distinct prime factors as k, or rad(d) = rad(k), where rad(k) is the largest squarefree divisor of k (A007947). The number of these divisors is A005361(k) and their sum is csigma(k) = A057723(k). Since csigma(k) is multiplicative and csigma(p) = p for prime p, then if k is coreful perfect number, then also m*k is, for any squarefree number m coprime to k, gcd(m, k) = 1. Thus there are infinitely many coreful perfect numbers, and all of them can be generated from the sequence of primitive coreful perfect numbers (A307959), which is the subsequence of powerful terms of this sequence. This sequence and A307959 are analogous to e-perfect numbers (A054979) and primitive e-perfect numbers (A054980)."
