        "Apart from missing 2, this sequence gives all numbers k such that the binary expansion of A156552(k) is a prefix of that of A156552(sigma(k)), that is, for k > 1, numbers k for which sigma(k) is a descendant of k in A005940-tree. This follows because of the two transitions x -> A005843(x) (doubling) and x -> A003961(x) (prime shift) used to generate descendants in A005940-tree, using A003961 at any step of the process will ruin the chances of encountering sigma(k) anywhere further down that subtree.",
        "Proof: Any left child in A005940 (i.e., A003961(k) for k) is larger than sigma(k), for any k > 2 [see A286385 for a proof], and A003961(n) > n for all n > 1. Thus, apart from A003961(2) = 3 = sigma(2), A003961^t(k) > sigma(k), where A003961^t means t-fold application of prime shift, here with t >= 1. On the other hand, sigma(2n) > sigma(n) for all n, thus taking first some doubling steps before a run of one or more prime shift steps will not rescue us, as neither will taking further doubling steps after a bout of prime shifts.",
