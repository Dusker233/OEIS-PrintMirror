        "Given n strips, each of length n squares (dimensions 1 X n), a(n) is the number of distinct shapes that can be created by setting the strips side by side while satisfying the condition that the shape must include at least one row of length L=n squares (row considered to be a direction measured perpendicular to the strips). Shapes differing only by a rotation are considered to be equivalent."
