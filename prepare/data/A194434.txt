        "On the infinite square grid we start with no toothpicks.",
        "At stage 1, we place a cross as a \"X\", formed by 4 D-toothpicks of length sqrt(2) and centered at the origin. At stage 2, we place 8 toothpicks of length 1. At stage 3, we place 16 D-toothpicks of length sqrt(2). And so on.",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage. The first differences (A194435) give the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage.",
        "Apparently this cellular automaton has a fractal behavior (or fractal-like behavior) related to power of 2, similar to A194270 and very similar to A194432. The octagonal structure contains a large number of distinct closed polygonal regions. For more information see A194270, A194440 and A194442.",
        "First differs from A220514 at a(13). - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 23 2013",
        "Observation: at least for the terms in the Data section the graph also appears to be a companion of the graph of A187210 but that could be different comparing more terms. - _Omar E. Pol_, Jun 24 2022"
