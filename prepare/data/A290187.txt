        "Like the known Tower of Hanoi you have 3 rods with n discs in descending sizes. But here on the first rod there are n red discs, on the 2nd n blue discs and on the 3rd n white ones.",
        "The task is to rearrange the discs so that red ones go to rod 2, the blue ones to rod 3 and the white ones to rod 1. Sequence lists the number of minimum moves needed to rearrange the discs.",
        "I have written a program to find the minimum moves, it might be improved for higher values."
