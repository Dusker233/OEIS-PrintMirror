    "comment": [
        "Ignoring the first two terms, a(n+1) is very similar to floor(n*e) (the Beatty sequence for e, A022843). This breaks down at n=11, where a(12)=30 and floor(11*e)=29. The successive terms (or partial denominators) in the sequence differ by 3 except for semi-regular \"glitches\". For example, the pattern of differences is 313233323332333233233323323332333233233323323332332333233323323332... A natural conjecture is that the mean of these differences is asymptotic to e. The glitches are positioned between terms n and n+1, for values of n which begin 2,4,8,12,16,19,23,26,30,34,37,41,44,48,.... If one counts the 3's immediately preceding the 2's in the pattern of differences, one gets the \"derivative\" sequence 233323233232323323...."
