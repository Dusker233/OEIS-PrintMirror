        "Consider a spiral similar to the spiral described in A239660 but instead of having four quadrants on the square grid the new spiral has six wedges on the triangular grid. A \"diamond\" formed by two adjacent triangles has area 1. a(n) is the total number of diamonds (or the total area) in the second wedge after n turns. The interesting fact is that for n >> 1 the geometric pattern in the second wedge of the spiral is similar to the geometric pattern of the fourth wedge but it is different from the other wedges."
