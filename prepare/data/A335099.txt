        "In the sieve of Eratosthenes, first the even numbers are removed, then the multiples of 3, then multiples of 5. In this sieve first the numbers greater than 2 and modulo 0 or 1 (mod 4) are removed leaving (1) 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15. Then the numbers greater than 3 and modulo 0, 1, 2 (mod 9) are removed leaving (1) 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 15. Then numbers modulo 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (mod 36) are removed."
