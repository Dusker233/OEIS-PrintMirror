        "This concept can be extended, since the sums of some numbers' divisors can be partitioned into more sets, e.g., 6 (2,3,7) and 10 (2,5,11) into three.",
        "Some numbers can be divided more than one way. For 10, there are two divisons: (5,13) and (7,11) and for 20, there are four: (5,37), (11,31), (13,29) and (19,23).",
