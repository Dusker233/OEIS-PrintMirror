        "Consider the unlabeled binary, rooted, leaf-labeled tree topologies with n leaves (A001190). For each unlabeled topology, choose an arbitrary labeling with distinct labels for the n leaves, and assign it to both gene tree and species tree. Compute the number of coalescent histories for that matching (gene tree, species tree) pair according to a recursion (Rosenberg 2007, Theorem 3.1). The sequence a(n) gives the largest number observed among all unlabeled topologies."
