        "The number of unique sigma matrices of endofunctions as a function of n where n is the size of the finite domain. The sigma matrix is an n X n preimage data structure in which an arbitrary entry is given by sigma[i,j] = abs(f(x_{i})^{-j}). In other words, given an endofunction on X, the sigma matrix captures the size of the j-back inverse applied to the i-th domain element of X."

    "example": [
        "A two-element domain corresponds to n=2. There are 2^2=4 endofunctions on two elements. However, the only unique sigma matrices correspond to S1 = [[2,2],[0,0]] and S2 = [[1,1],[1,1]], and thus sigma(2)=2. See the referenced dissertation at the associated link for a full exposition including examples, definitions and theory."
