        "An alternating integer is a positive integer for which, in base-10, the parity of its digits alternates. E.g., 121 is alternating because its consecutive digits are odd-even-odd, 1 being odd and 2 even. Of course, 1234567890 is also alternating. An alternator is a positive integer which has a multiple which is alternating.",
