    "comment": [
        "The single-digit number 3, whose square is 9, has the highest possible digit average, therefore this \"trivial solution\" is excluded. However, the sequence could be defined as \"numbers > 3 ...\" in which case it would start 4, 6, 7, 63, ... see examples.",
        "It is conjectured but not known that there are only finitely many numbers whose square has a digit average above 8.3.",
        "Can it be proved or disproved that all terms > 17 end in a digit 3?",
        "Next terms might be 707106074079263583 (da = 8.25) and 94180040294109027313 (da = 8.275), but there might be other terms in between."
