    "comment": [
        "All primes, except 2 and 3, are of the form 6k+1 or 6k-1 for k a positive integer. The converse statement is not true for all k, so the sum of two consecutive primes is not always a multiple of 6. This sequence lists the multiples of 6 that cannot be expressed as a sum of two consecutive primes."

    "example": [
        "6 belongs to the sequence because there are no two consecutive primes adding up to 6. 12 is not in the sequence because 12 = 5 + 7."
