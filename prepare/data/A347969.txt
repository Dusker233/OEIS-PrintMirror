        "The general problem is to find such numbers which can be represented as the sum of three squares of integers x, y, z, and additionally also satisfy: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = k*(x*y + x*z + y*z).",
        "For k=1 it is simply a(n) = 3*n^2 given by A033428.",
        "For k=2 it is A347360.",
        "The present sequence is for the next k=5.",
        "All possible k-numbers are listed by A331605."
