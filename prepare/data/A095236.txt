        "More precisely: The first person chooses any payphone. Thereafter, each person chooses the middle of a largest span of unused phones, but a span of length L at the end of the row is taken to have length 2L-1 and its \"middle\" is the outermost phone. If a span has even length, either middle may be chosen.",
