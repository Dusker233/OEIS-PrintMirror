    "comment": [
        "The first prime in the sequence is 937. If a prime number p occurs in the sequence, then the repetend of the binary representation of 1/p is necessarily of odd length."

        "For example, 1/187 = 0.[0000000101011110011101011011101110001101]_2, where the bracketed repetend includes 21 ones and 19 zeros. Therefore, 187 is in the sequence."
