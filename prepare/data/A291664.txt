        "In Danish, when pronouncing a two-digit number, the last number is mentioned first; for example, '21' is \"enogtyve\" [\"one-and-twenty\"], and '121' is \"ethundredeogenogtyve\" [\"one-hundred-and-one-and-twenty\"].",
        "Please note that '100' can be both spelled and pronounced as \"hundrede\", \"ethundrede\", \"hundred\" and \"ethundred\"; similarly, '1000' can be spelled \"tusinde\", \"ettusinde\", \"tusind\" and \"ettusind\". The \"et\" in \"ethundrede\" is often omitted in daily speech.",
