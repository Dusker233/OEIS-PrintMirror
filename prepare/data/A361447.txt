    "name": "Number of connected 3-regular (cubic) multigraphs on 2n unlabeled nodes rooted at an unoriented edge (or loop) whose removal does not disconnect the graph, loops allowed.",
    "comment": [
        "a(0) = 1 by convention. Loops add two to the degree of a node.",
        "Instead of a rooted edge, the graph can be considered to have a pair of external legs (or half-edges). The external legs add 1 to the degree of a node, but do not contribute to the connectivity of the graph.",
        "The 4-regular version of this sequence is A361135 since removing a single edge from a connected even degree regular graph cannot disconnect the graph."
