        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one edge consisting of the indices (or positions) of the edges containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,3}} is {{1},{1,2},{2}}. An antichain is a set of multisets, none of which is a submultiset of any other."
