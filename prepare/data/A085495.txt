        "a(n) is also the maximal order of a finite subgroup of the group GL(n,Z). This is because every finite subgroup of GL(n,Q) is conjugate to a subgroup of GL(n,Z). See the Math Overflow link below.",
        "Conjecture: a(n)/2 is the maximal order of a finite subgroup of the group SL(n,Q) (or equivalently, SL(n,Z), since a finite subgroup of SL(n,Q) must be conjugate to a subgroup of SL(n,Z)). This is obviously true for odd n: given a finite subgroup G of SL(n,Q), a subgroup of GL(n,Q) of order 2*|G| can be attained by adjoining -I_n where I_n is the identity matrix. The conjecture is also correct for n = 2, since the finite subgroup of the maximal order of SL(n,Q) is isomorphic to C_6. (End)"
