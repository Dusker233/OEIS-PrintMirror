        "An even number k is congruent to either 0 or 2 mod 4. If congruent to 0, it is divisible by 4 and thus not squarefree. If k is congruent to 2, k+1 will be one less than a multiple of 4, and thus at least one prime factor of k+1 will be one less than a multiple of 4. Thus, there are no even numbers in this sequence.",
        "From the author's comment above, all sequence terms must be odd, so k+1 must always be even and k+1 will always be singly even. - _Ray Chandler_, Aug 03 2015"
