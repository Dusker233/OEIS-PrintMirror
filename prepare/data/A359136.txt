        "A prime p with decimal expansion p = d_1 d_2 ... d_m is in this sequence iff there is a non-identity permutation pi in S_m such that q = d_pi(1) d_pi(2) ... d_pi(m) is also a prime. The prime q may or may not be equal to p.  Leading zeros are permitted in q.",
        "One must be careful when using the phrase \"nontrivial permutation of the digits\". When the first and third digits of 101 are exchanged, this is applying the nontrivial permutation (1,3) in S_3 to the digits, leaving the number itself unchanged. One should specify whether it is the permutation that is nontrivial, or its action on what is being permuted. In this sequence and A359137, we mean that the permutation itself is nontrivial.",
