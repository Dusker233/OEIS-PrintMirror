        "Contains the Mersenne primes M_p for p>3 as a subsequence, as 2^a+2^b cannot exceed 2^(p-1)+2^(p-2) which is less than 2^p-2 is p>3.",
        "Mariusz Ska\u0142ba conjectures that this sequence has density zero among all primes but contains infinitely many primes based on the following observations. For any prime p in this sequence, the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is <p^0.8 (Erd\u0151s conjectures that the set of such primes must have density zero among all primes). Moreover, any number of the form 2^m-1 the number of whose prime factors counted with multiplicity is <log m/log 3 has at least one prime factor in this sequence (the infinitude of such numbers may be more tractable than the infinitude of Mersenne primes). - _Tomohiro Yamada_, Aug 08 2019"
