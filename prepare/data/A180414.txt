        "In \"addendum\" J. Karnofsky stated the value a(15) = 1064833. In contrast to the terms up to and including a(14), which could all be confirmed, an independent calculation based on a list of 3-connected simple graphs resulted in the corrected value a(15) = 1064835. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Dec 06 2020",
