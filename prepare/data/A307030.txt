        "The one-line notation of any permutation p has a unique factorization into runs p = B1,B2,...,Bk, where each Bi is a run (a sequence of increasing values), and the first element of B(i+1) is smaller than the last element of Bi. If the permutation p is such that each pair of adjacent runs Bi, B(i+1) have an overlapping range, that is the intervals [min(Bi),max(Bi)] and [min(B(i+1)),max(B(i+1))] have a nonempty intersection, then we say that p has overlapping runs.",
