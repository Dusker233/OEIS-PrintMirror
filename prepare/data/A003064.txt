        "An addition chain of length n for a number a is a sequence 1 = a_0, a_1,..., a_n = a such that for each i>0, a_i is the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) elements of the sequence. - _Glen Whitney_, Nov 09 2021",

The sequence b(n) of the smallest number which requires n small steps in an addition chain is a subsequence of this sequence, starting a(0), a(2), a(4), a(7), a(10), a(15), a(21), a(28), a(37), a(46),... - _Glen Whitney_, Nov 09 2021"
