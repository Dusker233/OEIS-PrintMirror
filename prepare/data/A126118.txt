        "With a=b=1 and c=0, both a^2 + b^2 + c^2 and a^4 + b^4 + c^4 would yield 2 (a prime); similarly, with a=b=c=1, both sums would yield 3 (also a prime). Thus, without the \"larger than the first one\" constraint, both 2 and 3 would be terms of this sequence. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jun 15 2021"
