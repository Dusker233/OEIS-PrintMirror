        "The pattern in the primorial base expansion (A049345) of the terms is constructed recursively, so that the digit-positions of the primorial base expansion are successively filled with the positive terms of this sequence (1, 3, 9, 21, ...), up to that term that still fits to the position, i.e., is less than prime(i), for the positions i >= 1 indexed from the least significant end of the expansion. The nonleading digits are \"frozen\", and only the most significant digit keeps on increasing from a(1) to the maximal allowed a(x) for its position, after which the next term's expansion is obtained by prepending 1 to the front. See the examples."
