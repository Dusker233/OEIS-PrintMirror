    "comment": [
        "It is easy to see that {sigma_k(N) mod N: k >= A051903(N)} is purely periodic.",
        "All terms are nonsquarefree: if N is squarefree and N is here, then A328919(N) < A051903(N) = 1, so A328919(N) = 0. By the property mentioned in A328919, a necessary condition is that for every prime p dividing N, write N = p*s, we have p divides d(s), d = A000005. But d(s) is a power of 2, so N = 2, and 2 is not here.",
        "Although it seems that for most N we have A328919(N) = A051903(N), this sequence is infinite. See A328934 for more information."

        "If N = p^e for prime p, then A328919(p^e) = A051903(p^e) = e. So this sequence and A000961 have empty intersection."
