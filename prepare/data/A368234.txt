        "In nondeterministic walks (N-walks) the steps are sets and called N-steps. N-walks start at 0 and are concatenations of such N-steps such that all possible extensions are explored in parallel. The nondeterministic Dyck step set is { {-1}, {1}, {-1,1} }. Such an N-walk is called an N-excursion if it contains at least one trajectory that is a classical excursion, i.e., never crosses the x-axis, and starts and ends at 0 (for more details see the de Panafieu-Wallner article)."
