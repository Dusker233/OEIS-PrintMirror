        "This sequence is for base b=10. For each base b > 2, the last term of the corresponding sequence has b^2 - b - 1 digits.",
        "For b > 2, the final term of the sequence equals b^((b-1)^2 - 2) - (b-1)*b^((b-1)*b - 1) + ((b^(b-1) - 1)/(b-1)) * b^(b-1) * ((b-1)*b^(b*(b-1)) - b^((b-1)^2 + 1) + 1)/(b^(b-1) - 1)^2. The base-b expansion of this number is the concatenation of b-2 digits b-1, 1 digit b-2, 1 digit b-1, b-3 digits b-2, and b-1 digits k for each k in b-3..0. This is equivalent to taking a string of digits consisting of b-1 copies of every valid base-b digit (0..b-1), sorting its digits in descending order, removing one of the digits b-2, and then swapping the positions of the last digit b-1 and the first digit b-2. (Thus, for b=10, the base-10 expansion of the final term is the concatenation of eight 9's, one 8, one 9, seven 8's, nine 7's, nine 6's, ..., nine 1's, and nine 0's.) - _Jon E.
