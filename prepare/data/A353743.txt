        "Every sequence can be uniquely split into a sequence of non-overlapping runs. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are ((2,2),(1,1,1),(3),(2,2)), with sums (4,3,3,4). The run-sum trajectory is obtained by repeatedly taking the run-sum transformation (A353832, A353847) until a squarefree number is reached. For example, the trajectory 12 -> 9 -> 7 corresponds to the partitions (2,1,1) -> (2,2) -> (4)."
