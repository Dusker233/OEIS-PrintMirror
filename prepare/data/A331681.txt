        "Also Matula-Goebel numbers of semi-lone-child-avoiding locally disjoint rooted semi-identity trees. A rooted tree is semi-lone-child-avoiding if there are no vertices with exactly one child unless the child is an endpoint/leaf. Locally disjoint means no branch of any vertex overlaps a different (unequal) branch of the same vertex. In a semi-identity tree, all non-leaf branches of any given vertex are distinct. Note that these conditions together imply that there is at most one non-leaf branch under any given vertex.",
