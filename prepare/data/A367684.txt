        "We define the multiset multiplicity kernel MMK(m) of a multiset m by the following property, holding for all distinct multiplicities k >= 1. If S is the set of elements of multiplicity k in m, then min(S) has multiplicity |S| in MMK(m). For example, MMK({1,1,2,2,3,4,5}) = {1,1,3,3,3}, and MMK({1,2,3,4,5,5,5,5}) = {1,1,1,1,5}. As an operation on multisets MMK is represented by A367579, and as an operation on their ranks it is represented by A367580."
