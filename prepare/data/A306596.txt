        "A number is considered here (presumably) a Lychrel number in base 8 if it does not reach a palindrome within 100 steps more than the actual record. For those record numbers of steps, see A306600; for the corresponding record-setting numbers, see A306599. Futhermore, a Lychrel number is considered not to reach the trajectory of any smaller Lychrel number if it does not reach a trajectory of a smaller Lychrel number within 100 steps more than the actual record. For those record number of steps see A306851, and its corresponding record setting numbers, see A306850.",
