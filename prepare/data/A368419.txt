        "\"Reduced\" instances are counted, as in A351430 for order 4.",
        "Reduced instances are fewer than all instances by a factor of n!(n-1)! due to participant-renaming isomorphism, analogous to reduced latin squares.",
        "The counts are listed in reverse order from A351430 so that the known terms appear first.  The first term gives the number of maximal instances (with 16 stable matchings, per A357269).",
        "The total number of reduced instances for order 5 is 214990848000000000, given by A351409(5).",
        "The corresponding sequence for order 3 is [91,957,2840], with 91 maximal instances.",
        "a(0) = A368433(5) = A344669(5) / (5! * 4!).",
        "Results were obtained using the MiniZinc constraint modeling language, by extending the \"Model for the Stable Marriage Problem\" given in the MiniZinc Handbook, Section 2.2.6.",
        "The first two terms were obtained on a PC with 12GB RAM; the next three terms on a PC with 64GB RAM."
