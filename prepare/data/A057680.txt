        "The average number of matches of length \"n\" digits is exactly 0.9.  That is, we expect 0.9 matches with 1 digit, 0.9 matches with 2 digits, etc.  Increasing the number of digits by a factor of 10 means that we expect to find 0.9 new matches.  Increasing the search from 10^11 to 10^12 (which includes 10 times as much work) would thus only expect to find 0.9 new matches. - _Alan Eliasen_, May 01 2013 (corrected by _Michael Beight_, Mar 21 2020)",
        "Consequently, with the second Borel-Cantelli lemma, the expected number of terms in this sequence is infinite with probability 1. (Of course the sequence is not random, but almost all of the sequences corresponding to randomly-chosen real numbers in place of Pi have infinitely many terms.) - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 29 2013",
