    "comment": [
        "Connected multigraphs rooted at vertices A and Z can be considered as resistor networks with 1-ohm-resistors per edge and total resistance measured between A and Z.",
        "The networks counted here are a subset of the networks counted by A338999. Due to the 3-connectedness with respect to the two distinguished vertices none of these resistor networks is a parallel combination.",
        "For a resistor network to be effective, one has to avoid dead ends. A dead end is a subgraph which becomes isolated from the distinguished vertices by the removal of one of its vertices. Since the multigraph is 2-connected, there are no dead ends. Another consequence of the 2-connectedness is, that the resistor network is not a series combination (like Fig. 5 in the example).",
        "Karnofsky states in the addendum: \"A graph has no dangling parts that don't affect the effective resistance if and only if it is 2-connected. A new idea is that the essential graphs to generate are 2-connected ones with minimal order (edges per node) 3\". In this sequence there is no restriction w.r.t. the degree.",
        "So the networks with n resistors counted by a(n) are neither parallel nor serial combinations, but they form networks which Karnofsky described as \"h-graphs\" (see A338487). The number of different resistance values is the same as for the respective networks in A338487.",
        "Let us write Net = (E,V,A,Z) to denote the network consisting of E = set of edges, V = set of vertices, A and Z the distinguished vertices in V. Two networks (E1,V1,A1,Z1) and (E2,V2,A2,Z2) are counted only once, if there exists a bijection b: V1 -> V2 which sends E1 to E2 and {A1,Z1} to {A2,Z2}. Thus symmetrical networks w.r.t. A and Z are counted only once."
