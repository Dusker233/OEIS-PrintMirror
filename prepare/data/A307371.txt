        "Theorem: A number n is a term if and only if n is 0, 1, 10^(2m), 10^{2m)-1 or 10^{2m}-2 for some m >= 1.",
        "Proof: k <= sqrt(k)*10^m < k+1. For m = 0, the only solutions are 0 and 1. For m > 0, k^2 <= k*10^(2m) < (k+1)^2. This is equivalent to k <= 10^2m < k + 2 + 1/k, i.e., 10^(2m)-2-1/k < k <= 10^(2m). Thus the only solutions for k are 10^(2m), 10^(2m)-1 and 10^(2m)-2.  (End)"
