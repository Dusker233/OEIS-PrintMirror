        "Consider a two-player game in which players take turns and a player given the position k = p_1^s_1 * ... * p_j^s_j must choose one of the j possible moves p_1 - 1, ..., p_j - 1, and the player's chosen move becomes the position given to the other player. The first player whose only possible move is 1 loses. Terms in this sequence are the winning positions for the player whose turn it is."
