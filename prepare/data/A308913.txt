        "Pillai noted in 1941 that 7560 is the first term of this sequence. He also asked for the opposite sequence and wondered whether its first term (A166735(1) = 1163962800) is within the reach of modern computation.",
        "Since the sequence of superabundant numbers that are also highly composite, A166981, is finite, this sequence contains all the highly composite numbers above A002182(2567) = A004394(1023)."
