        "Primes of the quadratic form are a subset of the primes congruent to 1 (mod 24). [Proof. For 0 <= x, y <= 23, the only values mod 24 that x^2 + 24*y^2 can take are 0, 1, 4, 9, 12 or 16. All of these r except 1 have gcd(r, 24) > 1 so if x^2 + 24*y^2 is prime its remainder mod 24 must be 1.] - _David A. Corneth_, Jun 08 2020",

Note the significance of 24 being a convenient number, as described in A000926.
