        "An envelope number N has two parts E and C such that C is a multiple of E; E is the concatenation of the first and the last digit of N (the Envelope) and C is the concatenation of the other digits (the Content of the envelope). The integer 12348 is a member of the sequence as 234 (the Content) is a multiple of 18 (the Envelope): indeed 234 = 18*13. Contents that have a leading zero are not admitted (10347 is not a regular envelope number though 34 is a multiple of 17).",
        "Note that some envelope numbers might fit into another envelope (and so on): see the Crossrefs section.",
