        "For D=139, the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 6 has a solution is 59. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 6 has a solution is 163, but the smallest x in this case is 13, which is less than 59. The next prime, D, after 163 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 6 has a solution is 211 and the least x for which it has a solution is 27265, which is larger than 59, so it is a new record value. So 139 is a term of this sequence and 59 is the corresponding term of A341088, but 163 is not a term here because the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 6 has a solution is not a record value.",
