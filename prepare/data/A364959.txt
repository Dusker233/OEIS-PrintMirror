        "In contrast to condition A348717(n) = A348717(A163511(n)), which seems to admit only Mersenne primes for odd n (see A364297), here we also have some extra terms in addition to Fermat primes, A019434."

Moreover, any prime in this sequence must be one of the Fermat primes (A019434), because the primes are located at positions 2^k + 1 in the offset-1 variant of Doudna-tree, A005940.",
