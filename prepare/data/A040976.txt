        "The terms in this sequence are the cumulative sums of distances from one prime to another. For example for the distance from the first to 26th prime, 2 to 101, the cumulative sum of distances is 99, always the last prime, here 101, minus 2. - _Enoch Haga_, Apr 24 2006",

        "For each term d, there exists only one such AP of primes, and this one always starts with A342309(d) = 2, so this unique AP is (2, 2+d) = (2, prime(m)) with m > 1; so, first examples are (2,3), (2,5), (2,7), (2,11), ... next elements should be respectively: 4, 8, 12, 20, ... that are all composite numbers.",
