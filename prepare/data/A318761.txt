        "Note that for primes p >= 5, p always divides 2^(p-2) + 3^(p-2) + 6^(p-2) - 1 (see A318760).",
        "It's interesting to study the squares of primes in this sequence. For primes p >= 5, x^(p^2-2) == x^(p-2) (mod p^2) for any integer x, so p^2 is a term if and only if p^2 divides 2^(p-2) + 3^(p-2) + 6^(p-2) - 1. It's easy to see that for any prime p, p^2 is a term of this sequence if and only if p is in A238201 and p != 3 (p = 2, 5, 61, 1680023, 7308036881, there are no others up to 7*10^10). - _Jianing Song_, Dec 25 2018"
