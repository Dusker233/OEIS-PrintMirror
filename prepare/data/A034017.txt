        "The positive definite binary quadratic form F = [1, 1, 1], that is x^2 + x*y + y^2, has discriminant Disc = -3, and class number 1 (see Buell, Examples, p. 19, first line: Delta = -3, h = 1). This reduced form is equivalent to the form [1,-1, 1], but to no other reduced one (see Buell, Theorem 2.4, p. 15).",
        "This form F represents a positive integer k (= a(n)) properly if and only if A002061(j+1) = 2*T(j) + 1 = j^2 + j + 1 == 0 (mod k), for j from {0, 1, ..., k-1}. This congruence determines the representative parallel primitive forms (rpapfs) of discriminant Disc = -3 and representation of a positive integer number k, given by [k, 2*j+1, c(j)], and c(j) is  determined from Disc =-3 as c(j) = ((2*j+1)^2 + 3)/(4*k) = (j^2 + j + 1)/k. Each rpapf has a first reduced form, the so-called right neighbor form, namely [1, 1, 1] for k = 1 = a(1) (the already reduced parallel form from j = 0), and [1, -1, 1] for k = a(n), with n >= 2.",
        "Only odd numbers k are eligible for representation, because 2*T(j) + 1, with the triangular numbers T = A000217, is odd. The odd k with at least one solution of the congruence are then the members of the present sequence.",
        "The solutions of the reduced forms F = [1, 1, 1] and F' = [1, -1, 1] representing k are related by type I equivalence because of the first two entries ([a, a, c] == [a, -a, c]), and also by type II equivalence because [a, b, a] == [a, -b, a], for positive b. These transformation matrices are R_I =  Matrix([1, -1],[0, 1]) and R_{II} = Matrix([0, -1], [1, 0]), respectively, to obtain the forms with negative second entry from the ones with positive second entry. The corresponding solutions (x, y)^t (t for transposed) are related by the inverse of these matrices.",
        "The table with the A341422(n) solutions j of the congruence given above are given in A343232. (End)",
