If the area of triangle ABE is u and the area of triangle CDE is v, with u>v, then the area of trapezoid ABCD is w = u + v + 2*sqrt(u*v); in this case, u, v, w are integer solutions iff (u,v,w) = (k*s^2,k*t^2,k*(s+t)^2), with s>t and k positives; hence, w is a term of this sequence (see IMTS link).
