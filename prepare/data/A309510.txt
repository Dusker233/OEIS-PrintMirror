        "196883 = 47*59*71 is the degree of the smallest faithful complex representation of the Monster group M.",
        "This degree, as a number, has 8 divisors.",
        "Note that 2337 = 47*59, 3337 = 47*71 and 4189 = 59*71.",
        "It is related to the sequence A199014 (the divisors of 196884) through a phenomenon called \"monstrous moonshine\", or 196884 = 196883 + 1.",
        "More specifically (adapted from Wikipedia), the Griess algebra is a commutative non-associative algebra on a real vector space of dimension 196884 with M as its automorphism group. It is named after mathematician R. L. Griess, who constructed it in 1980 and used it in 1982 to construct M. The Monster fixes (vectorwise) a 1-space in this algebra and acts absolutely irreducibly on the 196883-dimensional orthogonal complement of this 1-space."
