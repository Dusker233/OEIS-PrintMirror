    "name": "Common denominators of all Egyptian fraction representations of unity (EFROUs) such that replacing two terms with their sum never results in another EFROU.",
    "comment": [
        "The relevant EFROUs serve as generators, general EFROUs arising by repeatedly replacing terms 1/a with 1/b + 1/c.  a(b+c)=bc requires taking b=D(B+C)B and c=D(B+C)C, where B,C|a, gcd(B,C)=1 and D=a/BC."

    "example": [
        "For 6, 1 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 (combining 1/3 + 1/6 would duplicate 1/2). For 20, 1 =  1/2 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/20.  Observe that 1 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/12 + 1/20 + 1/30 has common denominator 60 even though 1/60 itself does not appear as a summand; since also 1 =  1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/10 + 1/12 + 1/30, uniqueness fails for the relevant EFROU, the first such example."
