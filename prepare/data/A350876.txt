    "name": "a(n) is the number of nonisomorphic flexible left-right-alternative magmas with n elements. That is, a(n) is the number of nonisomorphic magmas with n elements which satisfy all of the identities x(yx) = (xy)x, (xx)y = x(xy), and x(yy) = (xy)y (for all x and y).",
    "comment": [
        "Compare A350873 and A350875, which are the numbers of flexible magmas with n elements and left-right-alternative magmas with n elements (up to isomorphism). The fact that a(n) < A350875(n) for n >= 3 means that left-right-alternativity for magmas (the identities (xx)y = x(xy) and x(yy) = (xy)y) does not imply flexibility (x(yx) = (xy)x). This is in contrast to the situation for non-associative rings, where this implication does hold (due to the additional additive structure)."
