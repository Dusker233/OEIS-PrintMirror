        "a(n) is always squarefree.",
        "It is not known whether this sequence is infinite. Sequence A045882 is infinite but it appears that increasing runs of consecutive nonsquarefree numbers thin out very quickly. The requirement that the runs consist of 0's is much stronger and makes it uncertain whether this sequence is also infinite."
