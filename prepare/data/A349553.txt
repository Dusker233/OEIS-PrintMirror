    "comment": [
        "Let S(m) = {f(m/2)), c(m/2) : m >= 1}, where f = floor and c = ceiling. A halving partition of n is a partition p(1) + p(2) + ... + p(k) of n such that p(1) is in S(n) and p(i) is in S(p(i-1)) for i = 1, 2, ..., k .  The basic idea is that each term after the first is about half of the preceding term. (See A349552.)"
