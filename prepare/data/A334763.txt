    "comment": [
        "It has been proved that three consecutive Ulam numbers U(n) for n > 1 satisfy the triangle inequality. See Wikipedia link below. Consequently it is possible to create n-gons using n consecutive Ulam numbers. The sequence starts at offset 2 because using the first Ulam number generates a triangle with sides (1,2,3) that is degenerate with infinite circumradius.",
        "Conjecture: Triangles whose sides are consecutive Ulam numbers are acute apart from (1,2,3), (2,3,4), (3,4,6), (4,6,8), (6,8,11) and (16,18,26)."
