    "comment": [
        "There are 6 parts in a basic set with a given surface area (with addition of an empty cell in the center): A-part (19), H-part (21), fish (21), rooster (27) x2 and tower (35). For purposes of this sequence, the H-part and the fish are equivalent, since they contribute the same surface area.",
        "Equivalently, number of nonnegative integer solutions of the system of equations 19x + 21y + 27z + 35w = 96n + 54, x + y + z + w = 4n + 2. Here x = 3m + w, y = 2n - 4m, z = 2(n - w + 1) + m, so for nonnegative integers we have 0 <= m <= floor(n/2), 0 <= w <= n + floor(n/4) + 1 and number of solutions is Sum_{k=0..floor(n/2)} n + floor(k/2) + 2 = (n + 2)*(floor(n/2) + 1) + floor(floor(n/2)^2/4) for n > 0.",
        "Conjecture: upper bound can be reduced to n+2 (based on attempts to construct cuboid using nonnegative integer solutions with m > 0, where it looks like impossible to place at least all roosters and towers somewhere).",
        "The simplest way to construct cuboid of any size is to use cubes formed by 2 A-parts, 2 H-parts and 2 towers. We just remove an A-part from one cube and a tower from another to easily connect them together."
