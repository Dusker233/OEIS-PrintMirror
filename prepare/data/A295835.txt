        "With the exception of the pseudoprimes, it seems that this is a subsequence of A139035. Primes of this form (A139035) have two special properties. 1. There exists a smallest m of the form m = (A139035 - 1)/2 such that 2^m == 1 (mod A139035). 2. m is odd. The core of this definition is based on these two properties. The term 2^((k-1)/2) == 1 (mod n) is based on the first property, while the term k == 3 (mod 4) is based on the second property. The terms 3^((k-1)/2) == 1 (mod n) and 5^((k-1)/2) == 1 (mod n) I just tried freely to Fermat.",
