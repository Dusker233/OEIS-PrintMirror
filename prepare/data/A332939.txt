    "name": "The number of steps to return to the origin for a walk on a 2D square grid where the walk changes direction to move as close as possible toward the origin after it has taken a prime number of steps; backtracking on its previous step is not allowed.",
    "comment": [
        "Consider a walk on a 2D square grid which starts at the origin and may step in either the positive or negative x and y directions. The walk always continues in the direction of its last step until it has taken a number of steps equal to a prime number. The walk may then change to one of the four available directions so it subsequently moves as closely as possible toward the origin, the only restriction being it cannot choose the direction that will backtrack over its previous step. If the walks' location after a prime number of steps is exactly on one of the axes or on a 45-degree diagonal between the axes then it may choose either of the two equivalent directions as its next step, excluding backtracking.",
        "Given these rules this sequence lists the number of steps the walk has taken when it returns to the origin. All terms are even due to the prime 3 being at relative coordinates (2,1) from the origin, and as all subsequent odd numbers are a multiple of two units away from 3 in the y direction an odd number can never have a zero y coordinate.",
        "For a walk of 100 millions steps the walk returns to the origin 165960 times. The furthest distance from the origin is approximately 207.8 units, after step 20831533. The minimum steps between two origin visits is 6, which occurs at the beginning of the walk, from the first step to the sixth step. The maximum steps between origin visits is 7247, which occurs between steps 41331290 and 41338537."
