        "Miska (2016) proved that the complement of this sequence within the primes is infinite, and conjectured that this sequence is also infinite, and that its asymptotic density within the primes is 1/e (A068985). Numerically, he found that there are 28990 terms below 10^6, which are about 37% of all the primes less than 10^6."
