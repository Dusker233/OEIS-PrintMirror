    "comment": [
        "For every n, there are trivial solutions where an entire row is filled with 1's and an entire column is filled with 1's, and the column index is equal to the row index. This easily follows from the nature of matrix multiplication. Every matrix that has at least one of these row/column pairs along with any other 1's is also a solution because there are no negative numbers involved here. The number of trivial solutions is given by A307248."
