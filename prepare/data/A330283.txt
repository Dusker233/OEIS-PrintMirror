        "A quasi still life is a still life made up of two or more strict still lifes (A019473) that share at least 1 neighboring dead cell, but those cells still remain dead due to underpopulation just like if we were to separate those component strict still lifes. Contrast with pseudo still lifes (A056613), where the component strict still lifes share at least 1 neighboring dead cell that remains dead, but the reason shifts from underpopulation in the strict still lifes to overpopulation in the combined pattern."
