        "If the Goldbach conjecture is false, then this sequence is finite. It will end with n such that A280008(n) / A002375(n) = -1 since no further terms could achieve less than this value.",
        "If the Goldbach conjecture is true, then this sequence may be finite or infinite. The ratio A280008(n) / A002375(n) has a lower bound greater than -1 and the value of this ratio for record indices approaches the lower bound.",
        "It is known that this sequence has additional terms beyond a(7) = 17#/2 = 255255 =  A070826(7) since A280008(255255) / A002375(255255) = -0.76119 and for A070826(10) = 20#/2 = 3234846615 we have A280008(3234846615) / A002375(3234846615) = -0.78989."
