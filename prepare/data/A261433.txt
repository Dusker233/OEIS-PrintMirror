        "The terms of the sequence could be called \"Shy n n-digit numbers\" as suggested by Geoffrey Campbell, Long Term Visitor (Visiting Fellow), Mathematical Sciences Institute, Australian National University, cf Links.",
        "In base 10, x is a \"Shy k n-digit number\" if it is an n-digit (d_i) number such that x = Sum_{i=1..n}{(10-d_i)^k}. For instance, 2240 is a \"Shy 3 4-digit number\": (10 - 2)^3 + (10 - 2)^3 + (10 - 4)^3 + (10 - 0)^3 = 512 + 512 + 216 + 1000 = 2240. Again, 2149042 is a \"Shy 6 7-digit number\": (10 - 2)^6 + (10 - 1)^6 + (10 - 4)^6 + (10 - 9)^6 + (10 - 0)^6 + (10 - 4)^6 + (10 - 2)^6 =  262144 + 531441 + 46656 + 1 + 1000000 + 46656 + 262144 = 2149042.",

        "Subsequence of A052382. Sequence is finite and complete as verified by exhaustive search since all terms have 60 or fewer digits. Since all terms are zeroless, they are less than k*9^k which would be less than 10^(k-1) (i.e., have fewer than k digits) if k > 60. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Apr 07 2018"
