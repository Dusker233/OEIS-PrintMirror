    "comment": [
        "The fork-join structure is a modeling structure, commonly seen for example in parallel computing, usually represented as a DAG (or poset). It has an initial \"fork\" vertex that spawns a number of m independent children vertices (the width) whose output edges are connected to a final \"join\" vertex. More generally, we can have a number n of these DAGs, each one with m+2 vertices.",
        "When the width is 4 (i.e., m=4), these fork-join DAGs can be depicted as follows (we omit the first column for n=0 because the graph is empty in this case):",
