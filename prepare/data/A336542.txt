    "comment": [
        "The number of ways to write k as a number of two squares only depends on the parity of the multiplicity of 2, the parity of the multiplicity of a prime of the form 4*m + 3 and the multiplicity of a prime of the form 4*m+1 (See A025426). Terms in this sequence have no prime factors of the form 4*m + 3."
