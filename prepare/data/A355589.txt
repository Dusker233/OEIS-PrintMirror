    "name": "a(n) is the least distance of two nodes on the same grid line in an infinite triangular lattice of one-ohm resistors for which the resistance measured between the two nodes is greater than n ohms.",
    "comment": [
        "The terms are obtained by a high-precision evaluation of the integral R(j,k) = (1/Pi) * Integral_{y=0..Pi/2} (1 - exp(-|j-k|*x)*cos((j+k)*y)) / (sinh(x)*cos(y)) dy, with x = arccosh(2/cos(y)-cos(y)), such that floor(R(m-1,0)) < floor(R(m,0)). The values of m for which this condition is satisfied are the terms of the sequence. See Atkinson and van Steenwijk (1999, page 491, Appendix B) for a Mathematica implementation of the integral."
