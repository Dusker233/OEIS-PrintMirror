        "The Lucas cube Lambda(n) can be defined as the graph whose vertices are the binary strings of length n without either two consecutive 1's or a 1 in the first and in the last position, and in which two vertices are adjacent when their Hamming distance is exactly 1.",
        "The first Zagreb index of a simple connected graph is the sum of the squared degrees of its vertices. Alternatively, it is the sum of the degree sums d(i) + d(j) over all edges ij of the graph.",
        "In the Maple program, T(n,k) gives the number of vertices of degree k in the Lucas cube Lambda(n)."
