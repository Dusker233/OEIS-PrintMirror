        "Subsequence of A056709. The squares divisible by 2, 3 or 5 cannot be obtained. Most of the squares obtained seem to be squares of prime or semiprime numbers. Among the first 399 squares obtained are 289 squares of prime numbers, 104 squares of semiprimes and 6 other squares; these squares were obtained by testing the prime numbers up to 10^7. Deletion of the zero digits from primes up to 10^8 yields 929 squares of prime numbers, 506 squares of semiprimes and 47 other squares. Do similar results occur when larger primes are considered?",
