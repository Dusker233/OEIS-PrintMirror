        "Example: Taking \"0\" to indicate the \"left\" rotation (1,2,...,n) -> (2,3,...,n,1), \"1\" to represent the transposition (1,2), and \"2\" to indicate the \"right\" rotation (1,2,...,n) -> (n,1,2,...n-1), the sequence 10010121 (length = 8) is a minimal sequence producing the reverse permutation on S_5.",
        "It was suggested that a(10) = 61, but this cannot be correct. It would conflict with A186783(10)=45, the diameter of the set under these same operations. We must have a(n) <= A186783(n) for all n. - _Tony Bartoletti_, Mar 08 2019"
