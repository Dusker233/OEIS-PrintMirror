        "These are perfect squares containing each digit from 0 to 9 at least once and still remain square numbers (not necessarily of the same length) when reversing the digits.",
        "In 1905, inspired by a question about all pandigital square numbers containing each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once (cf. A036745, A156977), the British mathematician Allan Cunningham (1842-1928) asked for reversible and palindromic pandigital square numbers. In his answer, he gives possible solutions, but actually not the least possible numbers he was asking for in his question."
