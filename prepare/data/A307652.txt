    "comment": [
        "The Abelian sandpile model considers the behavior of grains of sand on a square grid when a square topples sand to its nearest neighbors when the number of grains in the square is greater than or equal to 4. Squares on the edge of the board lose sand from the grid when toppling thus a stable configuration for the grid will always occur after a finite number of topples. Starting with the maximal stable grid consisting of 3 grains of sand in all squares, adding sand to one or more squares, and then performing topple stabilization results in a set of recurrent configurations which form the elements of the sandpile group for the given grid size. This group includes one configuration which acts as the identity element for the group, i.e., adding the identity configuration to any chosen group element and then performing topple stabilization results in the chosen group element.",
