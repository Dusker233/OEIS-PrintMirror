        "If the first row is 0 0, the array can continue with anything; there are a(n-1) such arrays for n > 1.",
        "If the first row is 1 1, then the second row must be 1 1, and the third row must be 0 0; there are a(n-3) such arrays for n > 3.",
        "If the first row is 1 0 or 0 1, then the rows after that can alternate between 0 1 and 1 0 for any number of steps before going to 0 0 (or reaching the end); there are 2(a(n-2) + a(n-3) + ...) such arrays for n > 2. This gives a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-3) + 2(a(n-2) + a(n-3) + ...); to simplify the recurrence, apply it to a(n) - a(n-1), getting a(n) - a(n-1) = a(n-1) - a(n-2) + a(n-3) - a(n-4) + 2a(n-2). This proves _Colin Barker_'s recurrence relation below for n > 4. (End)"
