        "These primes were originally called \"hidden primes\", but since that term is already in use (see A187399) it has been replaced by an explicit definition. - Editors of OEIS, Dec 16 2019",
        "The following is the original definition. Assume n and s are positive integers. We say a prime p is 'reachable' from n if there exists an s such that 8*(p - (s + 1)*n) + 1 is a perfect square, and that a prime p is 'hidden' if it is not reachable from any n.",
        "Equivalently, a prime p is reachable if there exists m >= n such that p = m(m+1)/2 - n(n-3)/2.",
        "A description of the sequence as an arithmetic training game for children was given on the Sequence Fans Mailing List. A representation as a sieve is given in the Maple script.",
        "The game is to start at n and (cumulatively) add n, n+1, n+2, ..., m until a prime is reached, which appears to happen for all n, usually with m close to n, except for n = 3.",

        "Only one prime is eliminated (for n != 3) by each (variable sized) \"grid\" G(n) = (2n, 3n + 1, 4n + 3, 5n + 6, ..., (m+2)n + T(m), ...), since the scan stops as soon as the first prime is found. If used as a sieve in the usual sense, the grid G(n) should also eliminate all subsequent primes of the form (m+2)n + T(m). If this were done, only Fermat primes A019434 = {3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, ?} would remain. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 17 2019"
