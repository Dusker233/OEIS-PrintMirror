    "comment": [
        "It is easy to find triangular numbers that are square, pentagonal, hexagonal, etc.  So it is somewhat surprising that there are no triangular 11-gonal numbers other than 0 and 1. For these n, the equation x^2 + x = (n-2)*y^2 - (n-4)*y has no integer solutions x>1 and y>1.",
        "Chu shows how to transform the equation into a generalized Pell equation. When n has the form k^2+2 (A059100), then the Pell equation has only a finite number of solutions and it is simple to select the n that produce no integer solutions greater than 1.",
        "The general case is in A188950."
