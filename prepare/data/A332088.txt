        "See A180632 for more about superpermutations, i.e., strings over a finite alphabet, say {1, ..., n}, that contain all permutations thereof as a substring. \"Digits taken according to ...\" means the number whose i-th digit is d[s[i]], 1 <= i <= A180632(#d), where d and s are the sequences of digits of the prime and of the superpermutation, respectively.",
        "In March 2014, Ben Chaffin showed that minimal superpermutations of order n = 5 have length 153, and found all 8 distinct superpermutations of this kind (the lexicographically first being non-palindromic), so the 5-digit terms are known. For n = 6, Robin Houston has found a few months later several superpermutations of length 872 (one less than the previously conjectured minimal length), but we still don't know which is the shortest (and/or lexico-first) superpermutation for that case.",
        "This is a variant of A244311, which (by definition) lacks single-digit terms and which uses the easily computed palindromic superpermutations produced by the classical recursive algorithm (see PARI code there), of non-minimal length A007489(n) for n > 5 and non-minimal lex order for n = 5. The lexico-first minimal-length superpermutations aren't palindromic, and therefore the corresponding primes aren't so here, in contrast to A244311."
