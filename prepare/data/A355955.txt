        "The terms are obtained by a high-precision evaluation of the integral R(j,k) = (1/Pi) * Integral_{beta=0..Pi} (1 - exp(-abs(j)*alphas(beta))*cos(k*beta)) / sinh(alphas(beta)), with alphas(beta) = log(2 - cos(beta) + sqrt(3 + cos(beta)*(cos(beta) - 4))) such that floor(R(m-1,0)) < floor(R(m,0)). The values of m for which this condition is satisfied are the terms of the sequence. See Atkinson and van Steenwijk (1999, page 491, Appendix B) for a Mathematica implementation of the integral.",
