    "comment": [
        "Wilkinson's 123-circle packing (that is my name for it) is a packing of non-overlapping circles in the plane, and can be seen in the links in A348227. There are three sizes of circles: (a) radius 1, (b) radius 2, and (c) radius 3. See A348227 for further information.",
        "A convenient set of coordinates for the centers are: (a) radius 1: the points (8*i, 6*j), (b) radius 2: the points (8*i, 6*j+3), and (c) radius 3: the points (8*i+4, 6*j), where i and j take all integer values.",
        "The present sequence lists the exponents in the theta series with respect to a type (c) point.",
        "This theta series begins 1 + 2*q^16 + 4*q^25 + 2*q^36 + 4*q^52 + 2*q^64 + 4*q^97 + 4*q^100 + 4*q^144 + 4*q^153 + 4*q^160 + 4*q^180 + ... but the terms are too sparse for an OEIS entry."

This figure should be rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees in order to match the other figures in A348227."
