        "A Fibonacci tree of order n (n>=2) is a complete binary tree whose left subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n-1 and whose right subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n-2; each of the Fibonacci trees of order 0 and 1 is defined as a single node. In a Fibonacci tree the cost of a left (right) edge is defined to be 1 (2). The cost of a node in a Fibonacci tree is defined to be the sum of the costs of the edges that form the path from the root to this node.",
