        "Most of the terms appear to have relatively few and large prime factors.",
        "For single-digit n, the digit length of a(n) is 2^n-1, with each digit n, n-1, ..., 1 occurring 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^(n-1) times. However, this simple regularity will not hold for n >= 10.",
        "An alternative construction method is using reverse S of A082850.",
        "Yet another way is doubling a(n-1) and prepending n to get a(n). This formula is valid only for n <= 10: a(n) = n*10^(2^n-2) + a(n-1)*10^(2^(n-1)-1) + a(n-1)."
