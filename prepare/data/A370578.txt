        "No term can be 2 (mod 3). Proof: Otherwise, k + 1 would be a multiple of 3 while 3^k + 1 would not.",
        "All terms after 0 are odd. Proof: Suppose k is even, so that k+1 is odd. Let p be a prime factor of k+1. Then (by definition of k) 3^k == -1 (mod p) and 3^(2k) == 1 (mod p), so the order of 3 (mod p) divides 2k but not k. Thus the order of 3 is a multiple of 2^(v_2(k)+1) where v_2(k) = A007814(k) is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of k. But 3^(p-1) == 1 (mod p) by Fermat's little theorem, so p == 1 (mod 2^(v_2(k)+1)). Multiplying this for all prime factors p of k+1 gives k+1 == 1 (mod 2^(v_2(k)+1)), or k == 0 (mod 2^(v_2(k)+1)). But this contradicts the definition of v_2.",
