        "Natural density 1, since almost all numbers and almost all primes (thanks to the prime number theorem) contain the digit 0.",
        "The first terms with smallest digit 1, 2, and 3 are listed in the Data section. The first with smallest digits 4, 5, and 6 are 644, 758, and 6666, respectively. While there are plenty of primes with no decimal digit smaller than 7 (see A106110), including many primes consisting only of the digits 8 and 9 (the 10th of which is prime(77777) = 989999; cf. A020472), it seems to me that finding a term in this sequence whose smallest digit is 7 or 8 should be a very difficult problem. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Feb 11 2019"
