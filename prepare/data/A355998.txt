        "Orthoplex polyominoes are connected sets of cells of regular tilings with Schl\u00e4fli symbols {}, {4}, {3,4}, {3,3,4}, {3,3,3,4}, etc. These are tilings of regular orthoplexes projected on their circumspheres. Orthoplex polyominoes are equivalent to multidimensional polyominoes that do not extend more than two units along any axis, i.e., fit within a 2^d cube. Two fixed polyominoes are identical only if one is a translation of the other."
