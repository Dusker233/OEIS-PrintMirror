Also, 7, 87 and 267 are the only nonnegative integers which cannot be written as w^3 + s, where w is a nonnegative integer and s is an element of S.",
        "(ii) Let k be 2 or 3. Then each nonnegative integer not congruent to 3 modulo 4 can be written as 4*w^k + s, where w is a nonnegative integer and s is an element of S.",
        "This has been verified for nonnegative integers up to 10^6."
