        "Conway and Sloane identify 5 conjugacy classes of maximal finite irreducible subgroups of GL_4(Z). Of these, 2 are isomorphic to subgroups of other groups in the list. The 3 maximal groups are: 1) the Weyl group of F4, the automorphism group of the D4 lattice, with order 1152; 2) the wreath square of the dihedral group of order 12, the automorphism group of the (A2)^2 lattice, with order 288; 3) the product of the symmetric group of degree 5 with the group of order 2, the automorphism group of the A4 lattice (and its dual), with order 240."
