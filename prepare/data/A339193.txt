        "Definition: A positive integer belongs to the sequence iff it is 1, 4, or a squarefree semiprime whose prime indices both already belong to the sequence. A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.",
        "In a semi-identity tree, only the non-leaf branches of any given vertex are distinct. Alternatively, a rooted tree is a semi-identity tree if the non-leaf branches of the root are all distinct and are themselves semi-identity trees.",
        "The Matula-Goebel number of an unlabeled rooted tree is the product of primes indexed by the Matula-Goebel numbers of the branches of its root, which gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled rooted trees."
