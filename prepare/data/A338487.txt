    "comment": [
        "A connected multigraph G with a selected pair P of nodes can be used to represent a resistor network. The edges represent resistors, and the total resistance is measured between the selected nodes. It is possible to construct complex networks using only serial or parallel combinations, but the more nodes and edges are involved, the more networks of a different kind can be found. They cannot be decomposed into serial/parallel elements. The sequence is on page 2 of the paper describing the computation of A180414 (see the Joel Karnofsky link).",
        "Karnofsky claims that he systematically increased the number of edges by three basic operations, C, D, and E, defined in A338999, i.e., he claims to have counted the CDE-descendants of the simplest h-graph (the \"bridge,\" see the example section). Numbers given in his paper are 1, 5, 37, 226, 1460, 9235, which is slightly off (see A339386). The difference seems to stem from the \"dangling parts,\" as he calls them in his \"addendum,\" so they don't affect the computation of different resistances in A180414.  - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Dec 02 2020"
