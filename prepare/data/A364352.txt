        "Refinement for drawing straight lines. Along the sides of an equilateral triangle with side n, points are marked that divide the sides into unit segments. Through those points, all possible straight lines that are parallel to the sides of the triangle are drawn. For n = 1..5, the link shows the construction of these lines."
