E.g., s(6) = (s(1)*s(5) + s(2)*s(4) + s(3)^2) / s(0), s(7) = ... .",

The involutions generate an infinite dihedral group. Already 2 consecutive involutions S(n), S(n+1) generate this group too. This group as a dihedral group has 2 conjugacy classes { ..., S(0), S(2), S(4), ... } and { ..., S(1), S(3), S(5), ... } of involutions. The degree of such an involution S(n) equals the degree of G(n+5) and the term a(n+5) in the actual sequence."
