        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.",
        "A composition is up/down if it is alternately strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, starting with an increase. For example, the partition (3,2,2,2,1) has no up/down permutations, even though it does have the anti-run permutation (2,3,2,1,2)."
