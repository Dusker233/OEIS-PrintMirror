        "Because asymptotically A072213(n) = A000041(n^2) ~ exp(Pi*sqrt(2/3)*n) / (4*sqrt(3)*n^2), the sum of the prime probabilities ~ 1/log(A072213(n)) is diverging and there are no obvious restrictions on primality; therefore, this sequence may be conjectured to be infinite.",
        "Curiously, both A000041(6^2) and A000041(6^4) are prime; in addition, A000041(6^3) and A000041(6^1) are prime, but for no other powers A000041(6^k) is known (or can be expected) to be prime.",
