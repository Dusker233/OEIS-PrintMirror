        "k^2 has been chosen as an arbitrary boundary, giving more terms of the (limiting) sequence (i.e., the unknown sequence that would result if no boundary were used) than using 2*k, 3*k, or similar boundaries. It is unknown whether there are values of k for which non-elementary loops exist only for values greater than k^2.",
