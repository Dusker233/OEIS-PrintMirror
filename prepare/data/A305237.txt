        "The next term is 3^541 - 2, which is too large to be included here. No more terms below 3^100000, or approximately 1.33*10^47712.",
        "There is a multiple of 4 in every four consecutive positive integers and it clearly has no primitive roots if it is larger than 4. Again, there is a multiple of 3 in every three consecutive positive integers, so it must be a power of 3 or two times a power of 3, and the other two numbers must be odd prime powers or two times odd prime powers.",
        "According to Pillai's conjecture, there're only finitely many solutions to |3^a - p^b| = 2, |3^a - 2*p^b| = 1, |p^a - 2*3^b| = 1 with a,b >= 2, p odd primes (no solution other than 3^3 - 5^2 = 2, 3^5 - 2*11^2 = 1 below 3^100000). So beyond (25, 26, 27) and (241, 242, 243), it's very likely that all three consecutive numbers with primitive roots are of the form (3^i, 3^i + 1, 3^i + 2), (3^j - 2, 3^j - 1, 3^j), (2*3^k - 1, 2*3^k, 2*3^k + 1) such that (3^i + 1)/2, 3^i + 2, 3^j - 2, (3^j - 1)/2, 2*3^k - 1, 2*3^k + 1 are primes, which only produces one more solution (3^541 - 2, 3^541 - 1, 3^541) below 3^1000000."
