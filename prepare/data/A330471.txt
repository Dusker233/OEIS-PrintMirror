        "A multiset is strongly normal if it covers an initial interval of positive integers with weakly decreasing multiplicities.",
        "A series/singleton-reduced rooted tree on a multiset m is either the multiset m itself or a sequence of series/singleton-reduced rooted trees, one on each part of a multiset partition of m that is neither minimal (all singletons) nor maximal (only one part). This is a multiset generalization of singleton-reduced phylogenetic trees (A000311)."
