        "This sequence was formerly called \"practical numbers (second definition)\" because it was thought this was the definition used in Srinivasan's original paper. However, in Srinivasan's paper, one can read that his definition is \"k < m\". Stewart proves that Srinivasan's definition is equivalent to requiring every k <= sigma(m) be the sum of distinct divisors of m. This sequence is a subsequence of the practical numbers, A005153. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 02 2010",
