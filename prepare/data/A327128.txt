        "A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges. We define the cut-connectivity (A326786, A327237, A327126) of a set-system to be the minimum number of vertices that must be removed (along with any resulting empty edges) to obtain a disconnected or empty set-system, with the exception that a set-system with one vertex has cut-connectivity 1. Except for cointersecting set-systems (A326853, A327039, A327040), this is the same as vertex-connectivity (A327334, A327051)."
