        "4327 is included because the smallest composite number whose sum of prime factors (with repetition)=4327 is 526809=4283*123, a multiple of the third prime below 4327 (not the first or second). 4327~3(30,8,6) is the smallest prime to have this property. Likewise 6947~3(30,6,4), and 7993~3(30,12,2)."
