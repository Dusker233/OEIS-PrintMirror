        "An algebraic number field with this capitulation type has a 5-class field tower of precise length 2 with Galois group isomorphic to the Schur sigma-group SmallGroup(3125,14). It is a solution to the problem posed by Olga Taussky-Todd in 1970."

    "example": [
        "The first imaginary quadratic field with 5-class group (5,5) and identity capitulation (123456) has discriminant -89751 and was discovered by Daniel C. Mayer on 03 November 2011. It has ordinal number 31 in the sequence A359871 of all imaginary quadratic fields with 5-class group (5,5). The discriminant -89751 appears in the table on page 130 in the Ph.D. thesis of Tobias Bembom, 2012. However, contrary to his assertion in Remark 2 on page 129, his method was not able to detect the identity capitulation. Consequently, Bembom only found a (non-identity) permutation (135246) but did not solve Taussky's problem."
