        "The lower asymptotic density is at least 1/2 by the 'almost all' binary Goldbach conjecture, independently proved by Nikolai Chudakov, Johannes van der Corput, and Theodor Estermann. (In this context, this shows that the density of the odd numbers of this form is 1 (consider A001065(p*q) for prime p, q); full Goldbach would prove that 5 is the only odd number absent from this sequence.) - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Dec 14 2022"
