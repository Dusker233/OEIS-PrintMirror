        "It is conjectured that 15/16 (93.75%) of the positive integers that are not powers of 2 have 2^4 as the maximum power of 2 in their Collatz trajectory (see A232503 and A355187). {a(n)} lists the remaining positive integers. Consequently, it is conjectured that this sequence will have lim_{n->oo} a(n)/n = 1/16.",
        "Among the numbers from 1 to 1000, there are 10 that are powers of 2, and there are 932 others (excluding 16) whose Collatz trajectories contain 2^4 as their maximum power of 2. The remaining 58 numbers are the first 58 terms of {a(n)}.",
        "If k is in this sequence then so is k*2^j for any j > 0. To find a \"primitive\" set simply eliminate the even terms (see A350160)."
