We assume we have boxes of different sizes and colors that we place on a circle to form a necklace. Two boxes of the same size and same color are considered identical (indistinct and unlabeled). We do, however, change the roles of the sequences (a(n): n>=1) and (b(n): n>=1) that appear in the weblink  above. We assume (a(n): n>=1) = CIK((b(n): n>=1)).",

In the third case, we have 3 identical boxes, each of which can hold 1 ball. This gives rise to 1 possibility. Hence, a(3) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.",
