        "The differences of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were increasing, so for example the differences of (6,3,1) are (-3,-2). The zeroth differences are the sequence itself, while k-th differences for k > 0 are the differences of the (k-1)-th differences. If m is the length of the sequence, its differences of all degrees are the union of the zeroth through m-th differences.",
