        "In atomic spectroscopy, a(n) is the number of D term symbols with spin multiplicity equal to n, i.e., there is one singlet-D term (n=1), and there are two doublet-D terms (n=2), three triple-D terms (n=3), four quartet-D terms (n=4) and five terms for every other D term of multiplicity 5 or higher (n>=5).",
