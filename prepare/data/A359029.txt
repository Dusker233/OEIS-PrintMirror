        "This sequence comes from a problem proposed by South Africa during the 47th International Mathematical Olympiad, in 2006 at Ljubljana, Slovenia, but not used for the competition (see link).",
        "In fact, the problem asked for a proof that, for the sequence {f(m)} defined by f(m) = (1/m) * ([m/1] + [m/2] + ... + [m/m]), where [x] denotes the integer part of x,",

        "Some results:",
        "1. For every m, f(m) = (1/m) * ([m/1] + [m/2] + ... + [m/m]) proposed in the problem is the arithmetic mean of d(1), d(2), ..., d(m) = A006218(m)/m.",
        "2. f(m + 1) < f(m) is equivalent to d(m + 1) < f(m).",
        "3. Each m = p - 1, p prime >= 7 is a term, so A006093 \\ {1,2,4} is a subsequence.",
        "Proof: in this case, d(m+1) = 2 < f(6) = 7/3. Since f(6) > 2, it follows that f(m) > 2 holds for all m >= 6; so for m = p - 1, p prime >= 7, d(m+1) = 2 < f(m) because when m >= 6, f(m) is > 2.",
        "4. As there are infinitely many primes, that also proves that f(m + 1) < f(m) occurs infinitely often, which answers IMO problem (b).",
        "5. There exist other terms not belonging to A006093: 24, 45, 48, 50, 54, ...",
        "Note that f(m) = f(m+1) is possible iff f(m) = tau(m+1), so f(m) must be an integer (A050226) but this is not sufficient. The only known term such that f(m) = f(m+1) is at m=4, with f(4) = 2 and f(5) = tau(5) = 2."
