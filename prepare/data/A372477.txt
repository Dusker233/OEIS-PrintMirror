        "The plane is divided into three equal 120-degree slices, and the illustration depicts a single slice. Along the boundaries of the slice, we build equilateral triangles beginning from the center with areas of 1,4,9,16,25 and so on. Then we build a segment connecting the free neighboring vertices of the initial triangles; this segment becomes the base of a new equilateral triangle, etc. In the Picture 1 and Picture 2 presented in the links below, blue triangles are equilateral, white triangles are not equilateral. In accordance with Pick's theorem for triangle grids, all triangles have integer areas.",
        "It is convenient to represent the sequence as a sequence of values of the areas of triangles located inside the slice of the plane. The first layer contains two triangles with areas (1,1) and is located in the center of the slice, the second layer contains triangles with areas (4,2,3,2,4), the third contains triangles with areas (9,6,7,5,7,6,9) and so on (Picture 1). Layer number n contains 2n+1 triangles (except for the first layer, which has 2 triangles). The sequence represents the values of the areas of these triangles collected into one set, with duplicate elements removed, sorted in increasing order."
