        "This sequence counts dissections of a convex 4n+4-sided polygon into one square and n hexagons, modulo a simple equivalence relation. The equivalence relation is not defined by a group, but by local moves. Consider the octagon formed by a hexagon adjacent to the square. The local move is half-rotation of such octagons.",
