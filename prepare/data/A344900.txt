    "comment": [
        "The characters of zeroth-order logic include the tilde (~), ampersand (&), wedge (\u2228), horseshoe (\u2283), triple bar (\u2261), left and right parentheses, and variables (upper-case letters with or without subscripts.) However, since the set of upper-case letters with or without subscripts is infinitely large, it is then, for the sentences of zeroth-order logic containing k variables, restricted to the set {A1, ..., Ak}, with an additional restriction as follows: a sentence may only contain Ai iff it contains every Aj for j=1..i-1 (this gives a total of A000670(k-1) legal permutations for a sentence containing k variables.)",
        "The rules for a well-formed formula (wff) of zeroth-order logic are defined recursively as follows (see M. Bergmann et al.):",
        "1. Every variable is a wff.",
        "2. If P is a wff, then so is ~P.",
        "3. If P and Q are wffs, then so is (PxQ), where 'x' is any binary logical operator.",
        "It is also customary to remove the outermost parentheses of a sentence."
