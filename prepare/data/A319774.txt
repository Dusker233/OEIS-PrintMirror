        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.",
        "A multiset partition is intersecting iff no two parts are disjoint. The dual of a multiset partition is intersecting iff every pair of distinct vertices appear together in some part."
