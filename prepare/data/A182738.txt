        "a(n) is also the volume of a three-dimensional version of the section model of partitions: the 3D illustrations in A135010 show boxes with face areas of 1 X 1, 2 X 2, 3 X 3, 4 X 5, 5 X 7 units along the m and p(m) axis, which is sequence A066186. Assuming that the boxes are 1 unit deep, the total volume of all boxes up to layer n is a(n). See the first two links.",
