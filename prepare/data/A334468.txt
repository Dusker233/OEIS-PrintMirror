Therefore we proceed to n = 3, which is prime and its distinct prime divisor again does not divide any previous number. Finally, at 4, we have the distinct prime divisor 2, since 2 divides the product of the previous range {1, 2, 3}, we end the chain. Therefore 4 is the first term of this sequence.",
