        "Inspired by A061777, let us assign the label \"1\" to an origin pentagon; at the n-th generation add a pentagon at each expandable vertex, i.e., a vertex such that the new added generations will not overlap existing ones, but overlapping among new generations is allowed. Each nonoverlapping pentagon will have the same label value as its predecessor; for the overlapping ones, the label value will be sum of label values of predecessors. The pentagon count is A005891. See illustration. [Edited for grammar/style by _Peter Munn_, Jan 14 2023]"
