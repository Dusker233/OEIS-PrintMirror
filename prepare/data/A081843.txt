        "A high proportion of terms are the same as A004938, which is the nearest integer to n*r, where r=2+sqrt(5) as defined in the formula section. Allowing for the difference in offset, the first 3 terms to differ are those which have values 46, 63 and 118 instead of 47, 64 and 119. - _Peter Munn_, Aug 07 2019"
