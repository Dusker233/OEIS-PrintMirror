        "Bracelets that have no reflection symmetry are also known as chiral bracelets.",
        "Here, for n >= 6, a(n) is also the number of dihedral compositions of n with 6 parts that have no reflection symmetry. Taking the MacMahon conjugates of these dihedral compositions, we see that a(n) is also the number of dihedral compositions of n into n-6 parts that have no reflection symmetry.",
        "A cyclic composition b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_k of n into k parts is an equivalent class of (linear) compositions of n into k parts (placed on a circle) such that two such (linear) compositions are equivalent iff one can be obtained from the other by a rotation. Such compositions were first studied extensively by Sommerville (1909).",
        "A dihedral composition b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_k of n into k parts is an equivalent class of (linear) compositions of n into k parts (placed on a circle) such that two such (linear) compositions are equivalent iff one can be obtained from the other by a rotation or a reversal of order. Such compositions were studied, for example, by Knopfmacher and Robbins (2013).",
        "Given a bracelet of length n with k white beads and n-k black beads, we may get the corresponding dihedral composition using MacMahon's correspondence: start with a white bead and count that bead and the black beads that follow (in one direction), and call that b_1; then start with the next white bead and count that one and the black beads that follow, and call that b_2; repeat this process until you reach the k-th white bead and count that one and the black beads that follow, and call that b_k. The corresponding dihedral composition is b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_k.",
        "If in the previous paragraph (given a bracelet of length n with k white beads and n-k black beads), we replace the white beads with black beads and the black beads with white beads, we get a dihedral composition of n into n-k parts: c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_{n-k}. These two dihedral compositions (which correspond to the same bracelet) are called \"conjugate\" compositions. See p. 273 in Sommerville (1909) for an explanation of \"conjugate\" compositions in the context of cyclic compositions.",
        "Symmetric cyclic compositions of a positive integer n were first studied by Sommerville (1909, pp. 301-304). It can be proved that the study of necklaces with reflection symmetry using beads of two colors is equivalent to the study of symmetric cyclic compositions of a positive integer. Clearly all the necklaces with reflection symmetry are all the bracelets (turnover necklaces) with reflection symmetry. See also the comments for sequences A119963, A292200, and A295925."
