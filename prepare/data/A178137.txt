        "Partial sums of primes in which neighboring digits differ at most by 1 (neighbors of 9 are 0 and 8 and 9). The subsequence of primes in this partial sum begins: 5, 17, 2003, 3467, 5231, 7349, 101141, 187367. What is the smallest value in this partial sum (after 5) which is itself a prime in which neighboring digits differ at most by 1? What is the analog in other bases?"
