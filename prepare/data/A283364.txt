        "If a(n) > 9 then a(n) is prime. Proof: If k = 2*m > 9 then 2^(2*m)-1 has at least 3 factors; being 3, (2^m - 1) / 3 and 2^m + 1 which excludes even numbers > 9.",
        "If k = 2*m + 1 > 9 is not prime then k = p*q, q, p > 3 so 2^(p*q) + 1 is divisible by 3, 2^p + 1 and 2^q + 1. If p = q then 2^(p^2) + 1 is divisible by 3, 2^p + 1 and (2^p^2 + 1) / (2^p + 1) > 2^p + 1. Which excludes odd composite numbers > 9 and completes the proof. [comments reworded by _David A.
