        "a(n) is the number of n-tuples of nondecreasing integers, which are the exponents of 2 in the partition, the first of which is 0 and which are \"reduced\". The 1-tuple (0) is reduced. If the tuple is (x(1), ..., x(n)), then it is reduced if (x(1), ..., x(n-1)) is reduced and x(n) <= ceiling(log_2(1 + Sum_{i=1..n-1} 2^x(i))). This sequence arose in analyzing the types of partitions of a positive integer into parts which are powers of 2."

In this recursion, F(n,k) gives the number of partitions with n parts where the sum of all parts smaller than the current part size being considered is between k and k+1 multiples of the part size. This function is independent of the current part size. In the case that k is zero, the only choice is to add a part of the current part size, otherwise parts of double the size are also a possibility. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Apr 24 2021"
