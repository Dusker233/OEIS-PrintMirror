    "example": [
        "As an example with n even, let a 2 X 2 X 2 grid be positioned so that the coordinates of two opposite corners are O(0,0,0), P(2,2,2) and consider the shortest paths joining them. There are (3!/(1!*1!*1!))*(3!/(1!*1!*1!)) shortest grid paths joining O to P with (1,1,1) as the middle point on the paths. Therefore there are (((3!/(1!*1!*1!))*(3!/(1!*1!*1!)))^2 = 1296 pairs of shortest grid paths in opposite order (joining O to P and joining P to O) with (1,1,1) as the common point. There are (3!/(0!*1!*2!))*(3!/(2!*1!*0!)) shortest grid paths from O to P with (2,0,1) or (2,1,0) or (1,2,0) or (2,1,0) or (0,1,2) or (0,2,1) as the middle point. Therefore there are 6*(((3!/(0!*1!*2!))*(3!/(2!*1!*0!)))^2 = 486 pairs of shortest grid paths in opposite order which meet at the middle point on the paths. This gives the total as 1296 + 486 = 1782.",
        "When n is odd, a(n) is the number of pairs of shortest paths which share the middle segment of their paths because the middle point of the path bisects the middle segment. For example, consider a grid of size 3 X 3 X 3, positioned so that the two opposite corners are at O(0,0,0) and P(3,3,3). The cases in which the middle segment joins (3,1,0) to (3,2,0) or (3,1,1) with 6 permutations give 4992 pairs. The cases in which the middle segment joins (2,1,1) to (2,1,2) or (2,2,1) or (3,1,1) with 3 permutations give 139968 pairs. The cases in which the middle segment joins (2,2,0) to (2,2,1) or (2,3,2) or (3,2,0) with 3 permutations give 19008 pairs. So the total number of pairs is 163968."
