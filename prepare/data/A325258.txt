        "a(n) is the number of nonnegative integers k such that the maximum adjusted frequency depth among integer partitions of k is n. For example, the a(5) = 7 numbers are 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.",
        "The adjusted frequency depth of an integer partition is 0 if the partition is empty, and otherwise it is 1 plus the number of times one must take the multiset of multiplicities to reach a singleton. For example, the partition (32211) has adjusted frequency depth 5 because we have: (32211) -> (221) -> (21) -> (11) -> (2). The enumeration of integer partitions by adjusted frequency depth is given by A325280. The adjusted frequency depth of the integer partition with Heinz number n is A323014(n). The maximum adjusted frequency depth for partitions of n is A325282(n)."
