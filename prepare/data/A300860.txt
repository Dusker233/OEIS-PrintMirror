        "Consider numbers in the cototient of n, listed in row n of A121998. For composite n > 4, there are nondivisors m in the cototient, listed in row n of A133995. Of these m, there are two species. The first are m that divide n^e with integer e > 1, while the last do not divide n^e. These are listed in row n of A272618 and A272619, and counted by A243822(n) and A243823(n), respectively. This sequence lists the record setters in the sequence A300858(n), which is a function that represents the difference between the latter and the former species of nondivisors in the cototient of n.",
