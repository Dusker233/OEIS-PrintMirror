        "That each term occurs in A025487 follows because (1), the abundancy index of prime(i)^e is larger than that of prime(i+1)^e, that is, sigma(prime(i)^e)/prime(i)^e > sigma(prime(i+1)^e)/prime(i+1)^e, and (2) because the abundancy index of p^(e+d) * q^e is larger than that of p^e * q^(e+d), where p and q are distinct primes, p < q, and e, d > 0. Thus, for any n, we can first find a \"prime-factorization compressed version\" of it, A071364(n), and then sort the exponents to the non-ascending order with A046523 (and actually, A046523(A071364(n)) = A046523(n), so we need to apply just A046523), to get a term x of A025487, that certainly have the abundancy index >= n [and this inequivalence stays same for their successive prime shifts as well, the abundancy index of A003961(x) being at least that of A003961(n), etc.], and as A046523(n) <= n for all n, it is guaranteed that the least k for which A336835(k) >= n are found from A025487, which is the range of A046523."
