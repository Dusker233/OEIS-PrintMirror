        "The Corner-turning Octahedron is a regular octahedron puzzle in the style of Rubik's Cube. The rotational axes of the pieces are parallel to the lines connecting a pair of opposite vertices. In comparison, the rotational axes of the Face-turning Octahedron are perpendicular to the faces. As a result, the only rotation of the Corner-turning Octahedron of size 2 is the trivial rotation of the tips (it is not the same of the Skewb Diamond, the Face-turning Octahedron of size 2). For n >= 3, see the Michael Gottlieb link below for an explanation of the term a(n)."
