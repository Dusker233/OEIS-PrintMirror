    "comment": [
        "The car moves according to the rules of the game of Racetrack with von Neumann neighborhood, i.e., if P, Q, and R are three successive positions of the car, one coordinate of the second difference (acceleration vector) P - 2Q + R must be 0, and the other 1, 0, or -1. The car starts with zero velocity at a point (x,0) for some integer x >= n, and finishes when it passes, or lands on, the positive x-axis after a complete counterclockwise lap around the origin. The line segments between successive positions must be outside or on the circle with center in (0,0) and radius n."
