    "comment": [
        "Given any number in the sequence, if you remove one or more digits from the beginning you always get another number in the sequence. This makes it easy to find higher terms -- just take an existing term and try adding a digit (with perhaps additional 0's) at the beginning. For example, to 6251 prepend 5 to get a 5-digit term, or 40 or 90 to get a 6-digit term."
