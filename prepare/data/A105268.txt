        "Primes which, upon subtracting one, give numbers which read the same upside-down. Not to be confused with strobogrammatic primes A007597 such as 181 or 619. Also, 263 is the largest known prime whose square is strobogrammatic. Not to be confused with strobogrammatic squares A018848 such as 109181601. After a(7) this sequence is exemplary, not complete (i.e. missing some values)."
