[With a slope of a(n)/n ~ 5e8 this would correspond to n ~ 600.] This sequence consists of first members of pairs of consecutive primes in A059044. Conversely, a pair of consecutive primes in this sequence starts a CPAP-7. This must have a common difference >= 210. As of today, the smallest known CPAP-7 starts at 382003672700092872707633 ~ 3.8e23, cf. Andersen link. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 27 2018"
