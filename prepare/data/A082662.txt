        "  (P1) is the new definition, repeated here for convenience. Note that this is not the same as saying A000265(k) < A172471(k), since A172471(k) = floor(sqrt(2*k)).",

        "(P3) The numbers 1, S_0, S_1, S_2, ..., where",
        "  S_m = { 2^(m+1)*(2^m+i) : i = 0 .. 3*2^m - 1 }.",

        "  The proof that (P3) and (P1) are the same sequence is not difficult and will be added later. (P3) is equivalent to a formula stated without proof (it may have been only an empirical observation) in the original version of this entry.",
        "(P4) Numbers k such that the odd part of k is <= A003056(k).",
        "  That is, the odd part of k is <= floor((sqrt(1+8*n)-1)/2). It is more difficult to show this is equivalent to (P1), but it is true.",

        "  (P6) was the original definition. In words, it says that the number of odd divisors of k is equal to the number of ways to write k as a sum of an odd number of consecutive positive integers, or equivalently as a sum of d consecutive positive integers for some d dividing k.  To show that (P6) is equivalent to (P1) one makes use of the Hirschhorn-Hirschhorn article.",
        "(P7) Numbers k such that the odd part of k is <= the sum of divisors of the even part.",
        "  (P7) was contributed by _Jaycob Coleman_, Jun 21 2014. To show (P7) is equivalent to (P1), write k as 2^m*s where s is odd.  Equality holds if and only if k is an even perfect number.",
        "(P8) Numbers k such that A000265(k) <= A000203(A006519(k)) or also such that A000265(k) <= A038712(k).",
