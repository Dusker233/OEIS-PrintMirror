So this sequence is the first m of each run of 3 consecutive left turns.  There are no runs of 4 or more since the turn at odd m alternates left and right.  Bates, Bunder, and Tognetti (theorem 19 page 104), show this sequence is integers of the form 2^p*(4k+1) with p>=3.  From which a(n) = 8*A091072(n) as Ralf Stephan already noted. - _Kevin Ryde_, Jan 28 2020"
