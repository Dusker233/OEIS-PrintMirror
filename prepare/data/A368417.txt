    "name": "Binary numbers B whose binary expansion can be split into parts s and t where B = s^2 + t^2.",
    "comment": [
        "The split is B = s*2^k + t where t cannot start with a 0 bit and k = length(t) is its bit length.",
        "For all terms except for a(1), the bit lengths of the parts are length(s) = floor(L/2) and length(t) = ceiling(L/2), where L = length(B).",
        "The whole sequence is also defined by the language {101} union {1^n # 0^n # 1 # 0^(2*n) | n > 0} union {(1 # 0^(n-1))^2 # 0 # 1 + 0^(2*n) | n > 0}. Note that this language is neither regular nor context-free.",
        "Proof: We have to solve s^2 + t^2 = 2^k * s + t. Multiplying both sides by 4 and splitting off squares results finally in (2^k - 2*s)^2 + (2*t - 1)^2 = 2^(2*k) + 1. I.e., (2*t - 1) <= 2^k, and thus t <= 2^(k-1). Avoiding leading zeros in t leads to t >= 2^(k-1). Therefore t must be of the form t = 2^(k-1), with k > 0, from which the only two (one if k = 1) possibilities for s are easily obtained from (2^k - 2*s)^2 = 2^(k+1) so 2^(k-1) - s = +- 2^((k-1)/2) and thus k must be odd, so t = 2^(k-1), s = 2^(k-1) +- 2^((k-1)/2), and k == 1 (mod 2). If k = 1, the solution s = 0 must be rejected."
