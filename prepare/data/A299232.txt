        "Suppose that S is a set of real numbers.  As S-power-tower, t, is a number t = x(1)^x(2)^...^x(k), where k >= 1 and x(i) is in S for i = 1..k.  We represent t by (x(1),x(2),...,x(k), which for k > 1 is defined as (x(1),((x(2),...,x(k-1)); (2,3,2) means 2^9.  The number k is the *height* of t.  If every element of S exceeds 1 and all the power towers are ranked in increasing order, the position of each in the resulting sequence is its *rank*.  See A299229 for a guide to related sequences."
