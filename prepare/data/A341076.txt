The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution is 19, but the smallest x in this case is 4, which is less than 7. The next prime, D, after 19 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution is 31 and the least x for which it has a solution is 11, which is larger than 7, so it is a new record value. x=11 is a term of this sequence and the corresponding value D=31 is a term of A336801, but 19 is not a term there because the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution at D=19 is not a record value.",
