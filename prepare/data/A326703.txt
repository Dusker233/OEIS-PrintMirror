        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every finite set of finite nonempty sets has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, it follows that the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18.",
        "Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges. In a chain of sets, every edge is a subset or superset of every other edge."
