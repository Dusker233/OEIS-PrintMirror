        "These are row sums of A332080, with terms interpreted as base n+1 numbers.",
        "Rows of A332080 are indeed the nonzero diagonals, read by increasing length, of such triangular matrices. In A332080 the nonzero part of these matrices is seen as a triangle; i.e., rotated by 45 degrees, say. None of the elements of this part may be zero, but they may have (not leading) digits zero. The elements of the vanishing part of the matrix are ignored or considered to have no digit.",
