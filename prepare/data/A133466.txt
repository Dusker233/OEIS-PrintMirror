        "It appears that all terms of this sequence are exactly four times those of the squarefree integers (A005117).",
        "The observed behavior is true for all n. All positive integers n are written uniquely as k*m^2 where k is squarefree, k >=1, m >= 1. The square multiples of n are j^2*k*n, j >= 1. We seek n with exactly 1 multiple that is square and less than n^2. If m = 1, there are no such multiples as we have k = n, so the least square multiple is n^2. If m >= 2, k*n is square and less than n^2. However, 4*k*n also qualifies as square and less than n^2 if m > 2. So the qualifying values of n are those with m=2. - _Peter Munn_, Nov 28 2019",
