        "The k-th Euclid number, A006862(k), is 1 plus the product of the first k primes, i.e., 1 + A002110(k). A113165 lists the numbers (> 1) that divide at least one Euclid number; a(1) = 277 = A113165(19); a(2) = 1051 = A113165(41); a(53) = 92143 = A113165(995).",
        "Up to N = 10^5, roughly 5% of the terms in A113165 are also in this sequence. Does that ratio continue to hold as N increases?",
        "It appears that the vast majority of terms in A113165 are prime, but that sequence contains a number of composite numbers as well, beginning with A113165(59) = 1843 = 19*97, A113165(125) = 5263 = 19*277, A113165(195) = 10147 = 73*139, and A113165(231) = 12629 = 73*173. But do any composites divide more than one Euclid number?"
