        "The volume of an n-dimensional L^p-ball of radius R is vol(R, p, n) = ((2^n)*(gamma((1/p)+1))^n /gamma((n/p)+1)*R^n for all real p > 0. For the Hilbert space L^2 we recover the familiar Euclidean volume of a unit n-ball (Pi^(n/2))/gamma((n/2)+1) which attains a maximum value at dimension n=5. The present sequence describes the same phenomenon for positive integer values of p.",
        "From _Robert L. Diersing_, May 26 2020: (Start)",
        "We can find very tight bounds for a(n):",

        "  floor(p*(c^p - 1/2) - 1/2) <= a(n) <= ceiling(p*(c^p - 1/2)).",
        "First we treat V(n, p, 1) as a real-valued smooth function w.r.t. n, then we can maximize it. Since log(x) is an increasing function, the critical points of log(V(n, p)) will be the same as the critical points for V(n, p).",
        "  (d/dn)log(V(n, p)) = log(c) - 1/(p(digamma((n+p)/p))).",

        "Therefore (d/dx)V(n, p) is a decreasing function w.r.t. n, which means there is only one local extremum. We can bound that local extremum similar to the way that we find bounds for the case where p=2 and the radius varies: see Wikipedia link.",
