        "All admirable numbers are abundant.",
        "If 2^n-2^k-1 is an odd prime then m=2^(n-1)*(2^n-2^k-1) is in the sequence because 2^k is one of the proper divisors of m and sigma(m)-2m=(2^n-1)*(2^n-2^k)-2^n*(2^n-2^k-1)=2^k hence m=(sigma(m)-m)-2^k, namely m is an Admirable number. This is one of the results of the following theorem that I have found. Theorem: If 2^n-j-1 is an odd prime and m=2^(n-1)*(2^n-j-1) then sigma(m)-2m=j. The case j=0 is well known. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Jan 28 2006",

        "Odd terms are listed in A109729. For abundant nonsquares, it is equivalent to say sigma(n)/2 - n divides n. For squares, sigma(n)/2 - n is half-integer, but n could still be an integer multiple. This first occurs for n = m^2 with even m = 2^k*(2^(2*k+1)-1), k = 1, 2, 3, 6, ... (A146768), and odd m = 13167. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 26 2020"
