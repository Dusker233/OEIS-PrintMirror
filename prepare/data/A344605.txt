        "We define a pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670. A sequence is alternating (cf. A025047) including pairs (x,x) if there are no adjacent triples (..., x, y, z, ...) where x <= y <= z or x >= y >= z. These sequences avoid the weak consecutive patterns (1,2,3) and (3,2,1).",
        "An alternating pattern of length > 2 is necessarily an anti-run (A005649).",
        "The version without pairs (x,x) is identical to this sequence except a(2) = 2 instead of 3."
