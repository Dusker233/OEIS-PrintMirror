        "This is a well-known sequence in the Bitcoin community.",
        "In 2015, someone, perhaps for amusement or to highlight the vastness of the private key space, crafted a \"puzzle.\" In this puzzle, they selected keys from a specific, smaller space and sent (see original transaction link) progressively increasing amounts to each of those keys, later the Bitcoin community found the private keys for those addresses in the puzzle defining this sequence.",
        "These numbers are the corresponding private keys for the Bitcoin addresses of the puzzle.",
        "This sequence is noteworthy because there is plenty of incentive to extend it.",
        "To this day, there is no known algorithm or closed-form expression that generates this sequence."
