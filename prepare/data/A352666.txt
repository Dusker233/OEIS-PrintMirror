        "Brown and Sidorenko (1994) prove that a bipartite optimal graph (i.e., an n-node graph with a(n) induced claw graphs) exists for all n. For n >= 2, the size k of the smallest part of an optimal bipartite graph K_{k,n-k} is one of the two integers closest to n/2 - sqrt(3*n/4-1), and a(n) = binomial(k,3)*(n-k) + binomial(n-k,3)*k. Both are optimal if and only if n is in A271713. For 7 <= n <= 10 (and, trivially, n = 3), the tripartite graph K_{1,1,n-2} is also optimal."
