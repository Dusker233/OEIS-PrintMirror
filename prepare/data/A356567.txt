        "With a(1)=1, a(n) such that (2*x-1)^2 + 2*a(n) gives prime numbers for x=1 to k where the k for a(n) exceeds the k for a(n-1), a(n-2), ..., a(1).",
        "Conjecture: this list is complete, since primes get farther apart as numbers increase. (2x-1)^2 + 2*29 generates many primes, with 38 of the first 43 and 105 of the first 156 values of x generating primes.",
        "For the (2x-1)^2 + 2*29 values that are not prime, there seems to be a restriction on the factors. No values with prime factors below 29 were seen, nor were 41, 43, 53, 71, 73, 89, 97, ... For each of the other a(n) (or indeed any other natural number K), it seems there is a list of acceptable prime factors for the (2x-1)^2 + 2*K value. This gives a curious connection between addition and prime factors.",
