        "This sequence has the same relationship to A001221 as A000523 has to A001222. Also, for n>=1, n-1 occurs as A002110(n)-A002110(n-1) consecutive terms beginning with term a(A002110(n-1)), where A002110 is the primorials; i.e. the frequencies of occurrence are the first differences (1,4,24,180,...) of the primorials."
