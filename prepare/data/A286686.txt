        "Each of these three four letter words contains exactly 2 0's, occurring among the first two letters and among the last two letters. It follows from this that the overlapping words of length 2 in the Pell word b induce distances between 0's in tau(b) of 2 for 00, of 3 for 01, and of 1 for 10. But then the difference sequence (a(n+1) - a(n)) = 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, ... is equal to the 1->3, 2->1, 3->2 permuted version of the 3-symbol Pell word A294180. (End)"
