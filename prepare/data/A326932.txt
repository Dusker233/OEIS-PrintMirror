        "Let q be a prime power. Each function from GF(q) to itself can be uniquely represented by a polynomial in GF(q)[X] of degree at most q-1. A polynomial g in GF(q)[X] is said to be a permutation polynomial, if the function x -> g(x) is a permutation of GF(q). a(n) gives the number of permutation polynomials in GF(2^n)[X] of degree at most 2^n-1 whose coefficients are all in the prime field GF(2).",
