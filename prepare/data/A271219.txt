    "comment": [
        "This sequence is, more interestingly, the number of logical consequence relations in (n+2)-valued logic, with no order between intermediate values (i.e., values other than 0 and 1), which are truth functional, identical to the standard logical consequence relation on bivalent propositions and value-monotonic (if the relation holds, it is preserved with stronger premises and/or weaker conclusions). See reference below.",
        "In n-valued logic with all truth values strictly ordered, the number of logical consequence relations with the same properties is more standard, it corresponds to: A030662. It satisfies the same definition as this sequence except that En should now be understood as a well-ordered set of n elements."
