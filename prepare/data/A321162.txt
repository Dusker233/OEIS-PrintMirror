        "Two words are conjugate if one is a cyclic shift of the other, such as \"enlist\" and \"listen\".  A word w is bordered if it has a nonempty prefix that is also a suffix (and not equal to w), such as the word \"entanglement\".   Harju and Nowotka show that for length-n binary words, at most n/2 unbordered conjugates are possible."
