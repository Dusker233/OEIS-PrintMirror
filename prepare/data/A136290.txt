        "This is the coordination sequence for Marjorie Rice's tiling of the plane shown in Fig. 15 of Schattschneider (1981), with respect to the central vertex. The Schattschneider illustration below shows that the first differences of the coordination sequence are 2, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, ..., and so the sequence itself satisfies the recurrence in the definition.  The tiling has symmetry group D_6 (the dihedral group of order 6).",
        "Continuing from the arrangement of pennies described in A136289, we also wish to place dimes over the holes in the array, where the n-th generation of dimes can be placed only when all three of its supporting pennies are in place already; then a(n-1) is the number of dimes in generation n for >= 1. - _Colin Mallows_, Apr 13 2008"
