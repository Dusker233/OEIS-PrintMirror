        "Consider words on n symbols that contain every permutation of those n symbols as contiguous substrings. The minimal length of such a string was conjectured to equal A007489(n) (see A180632). This sequence is a lower bound on the number of distinct (up to relabeling the symbols) such strings of the conjectured minimal length.",
        "It was conjectured in the Ashlock paper that, for all n, there is only one string of length A007489(n) containing all permutations. This sequence shows that this conjecture fails as n grows.",
        "In 2014 Houston has shown that the first conjecture about the minimal length is also false for all n > 5. In particular, A180632(6) <= 872 = A007489(n). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 28 2020",
