        "In the Mathematica program, we started with an inscribed triangle and a circumscribed triangle of a unit circle and used decimal precision to just over a 1000 places.",
        "The perimeter of the circumscribed 3*2^n-polygon exceeds Pi by more than the deficit of the perimeter of the inscribed 3*2^n-polygon. If we were to give twice the weight of the inscribed 3*2^n-polygon to that of the circumscribed 3*2^n-polygon, then the convergence would be twice as fast!",

Invariant: low(n) < Pi < upp(n); variant function: upp(n)-low(n) tends to zero for n -> inf. The error of low(n) and upp(n) decreases by a factor of approximately 4 each iteration, i.e., approximately 2 bits are gained by each iteration.",
        "From Archimedes's scheme, set r(n) = (2*low(n) + upp(n))/3, r(n) > Pi and the error decreases by a factor of approximately 16 for each iteration, i.e., approximately 4 bits are gained by each iteration. This is often called \"Snellius acceleration\".",
