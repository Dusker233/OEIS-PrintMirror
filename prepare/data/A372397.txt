Sloane_ observed already the relation between Hofstadter G/H-like sequences H_k and k-Zeckendorf arrays in May 2003, at least for k = 3 (see formula section and history of A005374). First observation most probably by Diego Torres, Nov 2002, relating the Hofstadter G/H-like sequences H_k with the k-Zeckendorf arrays and Lam\u00e9 sequences of order k (see comments in A005375 and A005376)."
