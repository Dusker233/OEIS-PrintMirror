        "There are only 15 numbers k such that there exist numbers M_k which, when 1 is placed at both ends of M_k, the number M_k is multiplied by k; 101 is the fourteenth such integer, so 101 = A329914(14), and a(1) = A329915(14) = 11; hence, the terms of this sequence form the infinite set {M_101}.",
        "Every term M = a(n) has q = 6*n-4 digits, and 10^(q+1)+1 that has q = 6*n-4 zeros in its decimal expansion is equal to 91 * M, so a(n) = M is a divisor of 10^(6*n-3)+1. Example: a(2) = 10989011 has 8 digits and 91 * 10989011 = 1000000001 that has 8 zeros in its decimal expansion."
