        "This sequence is a good upper-bound for the number of relations that converge to a quasi-order (A366252) which is only known for n <= 6.",
        "If the transitive closure of a relation R contains the identity relation then there is exactly one transitive relation in {R,R^2,R^3...}.  See Schwarz link."
