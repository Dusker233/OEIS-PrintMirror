        "In a multiset partition, two vertices are equivalent if in every block the multiplicity of the first is equal to the multiplicity of the second. a(n) is the number of non-isomorphic multiset partitions of {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ..., n, n} with no equivalent vertices. For example, non-isomorphic representatives of the a(2) = 5 multiset partitions are (1)(122), (11)(22), (1)(1)(22), (1)(2)(12), (1)(1)(2)(2). - _Gus Wiseman_, Jul 18 2018",
