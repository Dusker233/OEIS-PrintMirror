        "Call B(n, g) the number of genus g partitions of a set with n elements (genus-dependent Bell number). Then a(n) = B(n, 3) with B(8, 3) = 1.",
        "a(8) = 1 through a(15) = 565256120 were explicitly determined by listing of partitions of an n-set and selecting those of genus 3.",
        "The coefficients of the sixth-degree polynomial appearing in the numerator of the conjectured formula were determined by using experimental values for a(8) up to a(14); the term a(15) given by the formula agrees with the experimental value.",
        "Using the conjectured formula for a(n) gives the following terms for n=16..20 :  4593034160, 35025118700, 253374008888, 1753071498620, 11675101781850. The E.g.f. given in the Formula section is obtained from the conjectured formula for a(n)."
