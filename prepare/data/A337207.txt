    "comment": [
        "Consider a Go game played on general graphs instead of grids. The position that each group has at least one liberty is called a legal position. 2^(n+1)-3 and 3^n-2^n are respectively the trivial lower bound and upper bound of this sequence. The Mathematics of Go interest group computed this sequence up to n=481."
