        "For a nonzero term, the ternary code starts with 1, otherwise the balance of 1's and 2's is broken already in the one-digit prefix. Therefore 7, 19, 21, etc. (see A039001) are not terms.",

        "Each term with a ternary code of length k corresponds one-to-one to the Motzkin path of length k that starts with an up step. Therefore, the terms can be called digitized Motzkin paths.",
