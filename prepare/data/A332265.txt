    "comment": [
        "Only 4 and every third integer after 4 can create primes when concatenating the integer arrangements of 0,...,3*n+4 as the other integer values will create numbers with digit sums divisible by 3, and hence are divisible by 3. The digit 0 is allowed to be the first digit in the number but is then ignored when determining if the remaining digits form a prime."
