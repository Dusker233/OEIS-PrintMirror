    "comment": [
        "An XOR-triangle T(m) is an inverted 0-1 triangle formed by choosing a top row the binary rendition b(m) of m and having each entry in subsequent rows be the XOR of the two values above it, i.e., A038554(n) applied recursively until we reach a single bit. We may plot T(m) as an equilateral triangle, since each iteration decrements the binary integer length L of the output until we have L = 1.",
        "The XOR function used here requires two inputs; if the inputs agree, the output is 0, else 1.",
        "A rotationally-symmetrical XOR-triangle (RST) is one whose appearance is the same when rotated 120 degrees.",
        "A zero triangle of side length k arises when we have a run of (k + 1) 1s in the preceding iteration.",
        "This sequence contains m that produce T(m) with a recordsetting side length of its largest zero-triangle. For 1 < n < 3, T(a(n)) only has eccentric zero triangles. T(a(4)) has a singleton zero at center, thus a central zero triangle (CZT) of k = 1. For n > 4, all T(a(n)) have CZTs.",
        "The number 543 = A281482(4); we observe that A281482(2^i) produces RSTs, and only for 0 <= i <= 2 do we have eccentric zero triangles larger than any possible CZT. For A281482(2^3) = 131583, the side length of its eccentric zero triangles prove much smaller than the largest possible CZT.",
        "Since this sequence wants to maximize the side length k of the largest triangle, we see that the largest triangle possible is the CZT. Let j be the \"frame width\" or number of iterations required to generate the first run of 0s in the CZT. We note j >= 2, since j = 1 requires a run of (k + 1) ones delimited by at least 1 zero; such a width implies that these zeros occur at the beginning and end of b(m). However, beginning binary notation with a leading zero is not permitted. Therefore, if it is possible, we will see T(m) with j > 1.",
        "The numbers that produce record-setting m are the smaller of the binary reverse of m, therefore binary weight favors the least significant digits. Thus we see a 1 followed by a number of zeros in a \"prefix\" A that, along with a suffix C, must have the same number of bits.",
        "For RSTs with a CZT, we have only one way to produce a solid run of (k + 1) zeros, that is, by dithering bits, which necessitates paired 0 and 1, therefore, we have even k for n > 4.",
        "A run-length formula for a(n) with n > 4 is 12..i(11)..3, meaning that we have 1 one, 2 zeros, any number i of paired 1-0 bits, and a run of 3 ones. Aside from the reversal of this pattern, which puts a greater binary weight in the most significant 3 bits, there is no other way to construct a smaller (or any) CZT with frame size j = 2.",
        "This equates to linear recurrence kernel (5, -4) starting with {2391, 9559} (though 39 is part of the same trajectory)."
