        "Codes are vector spaces with a metric defined on them.  Specifically, the metric is the hamming distance between two vectors.  Vectors of a code are called codewords.",
        "A code is usually represented by a generating matrix.  The row space of the generating matrix is the code itself.",
        "Self-dual codes are codes such all codewords are pairwise orthogonal to each other.",
        "Two codes are called permutation equivalent if one code can be obtained by permuting the coordinates (columns) of the other code.",
        "The automorphism group of a code is the set of permutations of the coordinates (columns) that result in the same identical code."
