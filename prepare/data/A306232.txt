        "The starting number k and its reverse are regarded as part of the trajectory, so palindromes are excluded from the sequence.",

        "The first difference is obtained for 10969 which is in A063048 but not in this sequence, due to the fact that the reversed number after the first iteration, 78701 is the reverse of 10787.",
        "As a result, 16999 is included in this sequence while it is excluded in A063048, due to the fact that its number after the second iteration is 186571, which equals the number after the second iteration of 10969."
