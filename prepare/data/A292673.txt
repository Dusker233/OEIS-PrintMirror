    "comment": [
        "Consider the symbols as positive integers. By the greedy way we mean to fill the grid row by row from left to right always with the least possible positive integer such that the three constraints (on rows, columns and rectangular blocks) are satisfied.",
        "In contrast to the sudoku case, the 3 X 3 rectangles have \"floating\" borders, so the constraint is actually equivalent to say that any element must be different from all neighbors in a Moore neighborhood of range 2 (having up to 5*5 = 25 grid points)."
