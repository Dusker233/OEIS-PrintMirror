        "A prime p is called a unique-period prime in base b if there is no other prime q such that the period length of the base-b expansion of its reciprocal, 1/p, is equal to the period length of the reciprocal of q, 1/q.",

These are trivial bases in which p is a unique-period prime, with ord(b,p) = 1 or 2. By Faltings's theorem, there are only finitely many nontrivial bases in which p is also a unique-period prime, with ord(b,p) >= 3. For p = 7, the nontrivial bases are 2, 3, 4, 5, 18, 19."
