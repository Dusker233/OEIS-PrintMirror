        "A superset of A010785. Can someone calculate the index of a term k having d digits? There are terms like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1331, 2442, 3553, ... which have the property that a(31) = 1331, a(42) = 2442, a(53) = 3553 etc. Are there infinitely many such terms?",
        "The additional terms with that property, up to a(100000), are: a(64) = 4664, a(75) = 5775, a(86) = 6886, a(97) = 7997, a(749) = 947749, a(4978) = 87944978, a(46581) = 185640046581. - _Georg Fischer_, Jan 12 2022"
