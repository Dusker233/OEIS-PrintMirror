    "comment": [
        "In order to get the maximum number, the ratio of the two resistances should be a transcendental number.",
        "It appears that the resistance values always come in pairs, but this has not been proven. (This sequence only enumerates half). In particular, it seems that switching the two types of resistor and exchanging parallel with serial will always give a different value. Neither of these on its own is sufficient."
