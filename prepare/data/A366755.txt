    "example": [
        "For n = 5, all but two of the A002218(5) = 10 2-connected graphs are 1-tough, so a(5) = 8. The exceptions are the complete bipartite graph K_{2,3} and the complete tripartite graph K_{1,1,3}. To see that these graphs are not 1-tough, note that, in both cases, two vertices can be removed resulting in a graph with three components (isolated vertices)."
