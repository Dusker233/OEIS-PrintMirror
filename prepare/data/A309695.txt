    "comment": [
        "A prime 5-tuple is a set of five prime numbers of one of two forms: (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12) and (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12), with sums 5p+28 and 5p+32, respectively.",
        "For either form, the sum of the five members sometimes yields a prime. It has been observed that a prime sum is yielded less frequently by quintuplets of the first form than by those of the second."
    ],
    "example": [
        "For p=5, (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12) = (5,7,11,13,17): all primes, hence a prime 5-tuple. Their sum, 5p+28 = 53, is a prime, so 5, the smallest member, is a term of the sequence.",
        "For p=7, (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12) = (7,9,13,15,19); not all members are prime, but (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12) = (7,11,13,17,19), all primes, hence a prime 5-tuple; their sum, 5p+32 = 67, is a prime, so 7, the smallest member, is a term of the sequence."
