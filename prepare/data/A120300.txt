        "11131719 is the concatenation of 11,13,17,19, the primes between 10 and 20, chosen because they appear on the Ishango prime bone. Notice the consecutive values of 40, 41 and 42 above. Also 10^12678+11131719 and 10^12104+11131719 are probable primes (Fermat and Lucas PRPs) that occur in this sequence."
