        "More precisely, a(n) is the number of ordered pairs (S,T) of equivalence relations on [n] such that S*T=T*S where the operation * is composition of relations. The composition of equivalence relations is not generally an equivalence relation.  S*T=T*S if and only if S*T is the smallest equivalence relation that contains both S and T."

        "Let S = 1/24/3 and T = 13/2/4 be equivalence relations on [4]. Then S*T = T*S = 13/24 so (S,T) is an example of a commuting pair of equivalence relations (as well as (T,S) )."
