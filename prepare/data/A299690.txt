        "This sequence is finite. Proof: Let k be the smallest term with more than 2000 decimal digits. Then the product of decimal digits pk of k has fewer than 2001 decimal digits (otherwise k isn't the smallest term with more than 2000 decimal digits). This number pk has at least as many decimal digits as 2^2001 has, which are 603. But then it doesn't have a nonzero multiplicative digital root per the computations of _Charles R Greathouse IV_.
