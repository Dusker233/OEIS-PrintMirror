        "This sequence was inspired by unsolved conjectures related to the papers by Boyd (1994) and Krattenhaler and Rivoal (2007-2009, 2009) about the harmonic numbers H(k) = Sum_{i=1..k} 1/i. See also the comments for sequences A007757, A131657, A131658, and A268112. Here we are dealing with the alternating harmonic numbers H'(k) = Sum_{i=1..k} (-1)^(i+1)/i.",
        "For the harmonic numbers H(k), it is not known whether there is k >= 1 and a prime p such that v_p(H(k)) >= 4, where v_p(x) is the p-adic valuation of x. Since p cannot be present in both the numerator and the denominator of H(k), this is equivalent to saying that the numerator of H(k) cannot be divisible by the fourth power of a prime p.",
        "If variations of the above conjecture are true, then some conditional results in Krattenhaler and Rivoal (2007-2009, 2009) would hold. Boyd (1994) found only 5 integers k such that there is a prime p < k with v_p(H(k)) >= 3. Since 1994 no other k's have been found that satisfy the latter inequality.",
        "We claim that a similar conjecture holds for the alternating harmonic numbers H'(k): there is no pair of an integer k and a prime p such that v_p(H'(k)) >= 4; i.e., there is no k for which the numerator of H'(k) is divisible by the fourth power of a prime.",
        "This sequence contains those k's for which there is a prime p < k with v_p(H'(k)) >= 2. Up to 2000, we have only been able to find four such k's. The corresponding primes for 30, 241, 1057, and 1499 are 7, 19, 37, and 7. We have v_7(H'(30)) = v_19(H'(241)) = v_37(H'(1057)) = 2, while v_7(H'(1499)) = 3.",
