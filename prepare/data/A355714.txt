        "In contrast to A354169 (a set theoretic analog of A090252) where we observe many as yet unproved regularities, in A090252 the situation appears to be more complicated. This sequence is intended to help spot these irregularities and perhaps lead to further rules, which probably have no analogy in A354169.",
