    "comment": [
        "The terms are consecutive 12-tuples, ordered so that (A) a(12i-11) < a(11i-10) < ... < a(12i) for i > 0, and (B) a(12i+1) < a(12i+13) for i >= 0.  This sequence has primitive solutions only.  If k is relatively prime to all of the terms in a primitive 12-tuple, then multiplying the terms in that 12-tuple by k gives another solution."
