        "An integer partition is widely alternately co-strongly normal if either it is constant 1's (wide) or it covers an initial interval of positive integers (normal) and has weakly increasing run-lengths (co-strong) which, if reversed, are themselves a widely alternately co-strongly normal partition.",

        "This sequence is closed under A181821, so there are infinitely many terms that are not powers of 2 or primorial numbers."
