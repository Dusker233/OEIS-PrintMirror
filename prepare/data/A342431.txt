        "This is a variant of the stepping stone sequence (A337663), where any cell has just 4 neighbors (Von Neumann neighborhood). The game works as follows:",
        "Start with an infinite square grid. Each cell has four neighbors. Place n 1's anywhere. Now place the numbers 2, 3, ..., m in order, subject to the rule that when you place k, the sum of its neighbors must equal k. Then a(n) is the maximum m that can be achieved."
