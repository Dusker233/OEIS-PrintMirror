    "comment": [
        "For an n-antiprism, formed from two n-sided regular polygons joined by 2n adjacent alternating triangles, create all possible internal planes defined by connecting any three of its vertices. For example, in the case of a triangular 3-antiprism this results in 3 planes. Use all the resulting planes to cut the prism into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the number of resulting polyhedra for antiprisms with n>=3.",
        "See A338808 for the number and images of the k-faced polyhedra in each antiprism dissection.",
        "The author thanks Zach J. Shannon for assistance in producing the images for this sequence."
