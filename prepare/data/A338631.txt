    "comment": [
        "Context-Directed Swaps or CDS denotes an operation on permutations, and there can be several ways to apply it to a given permutation, defined by distinct contexts. Permutations that have the maximum strategic pile (cf. A267323) are of special interest. a(n) is the number of distinct CDS contexts that a permutation with maximum strategic pile in S_{2n} can have. The number is the same for S_{2n} and S_{2n+1}."
