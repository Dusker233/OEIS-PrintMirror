Let f(n) = A(n)/sqrt(n), then f(n) is multiplicative with f(2) = sqrt(2)/2, f(4) = 1/2, f(2^e) = 2^(e/2 - 3) for e >= 3, f(p^e) = ((p - 1)/2)*p^(e/2 - 1) when p > 2. Note that f(2^e) >= a(2^3), f(p^e) >= f(p), f(p) > 1 when p >= 7. For every number n, we have:",

        "So if k > 130729 is a term, then all prime factors of k are no greater than 113, and k contains at most one prime factor >= 23. On the other hand, if all prime factors of k are no greater than 19, then 53881 is a coprime quadratic residue modulo k because 53881 is a coprime quadratic residue modulo 2^3, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19, but 53881 is not a perfect square, a contradiction. As a result, k must contain exactly one prime factor p in [23, 113].",

Consider the numbers 53881, 86641, 87481, 102001, 117049 and 130729. At least one of them is a coprime quadratic residue modulo each prime p in [23, 113], so at least one of them is a coprime quadratic residue modulo k, but none of them is a square, a contradiction!
