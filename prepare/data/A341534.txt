    "comment": [
        "A cake of size 1 is to be divided between n people. The cutter iterates the following procedure: to obtain a new piece of the cake, he cuts the biggest piece into two subpieces (if several pieces are biggest ex aequo, he cuts just one of them); the cut is biased in the proportions t versus 1-t, where t is a constant real number between 1/2 and 1. We will assume that t is transcendental. After the procedure is applied, each piece's size is clearly t^x*(1-t)^y for some (x,y), ordered pair of nonnegative integers. The obtained ordered multiset of t^x*(1-t)^y polynomials depends on t and n; we shall call this the f(t,n) configuration. By definition a(n) is Card({f(t,n); t varies}), i.e., the number of configurations that the procedure for n people can possibly generate, when one does not know the value of t before it starts.",
        "The problem boils down to a geometrical one, where one has to compare the Y-coordinates of rotated lattice points, the angle of rotation depending on t: tan(angle)=log(1-t)/log(t). See SVG link."
