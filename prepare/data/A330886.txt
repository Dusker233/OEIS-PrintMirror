        "A border of a string w is a nonempty proper prefix of w that is also a suffix.  The SB (\"shortest border\") factorization of a string w is as follows:  if w has no border, then the factorization is just (w).  Otherwise, write w = (x)(w')(x) where x is the shortest border of w, and repeat with w'. The length of the factorization is the number of factors.  For example, 011011101 = (01)(1)(011)(1)(01), and so the factorization has length 5.",
