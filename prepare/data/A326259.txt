        "A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. The multiset multisystem with MM-number n is obtained by taking the multiset of prime indices of each prime index of n.",
        "A multiset partition is crossing if it has two blocks of the form {...x...y...}, {...z...t...} where x < z < y < t or z < x < t < y. It is capturing if it has two blocks of the form {...x...y...} and {...z...t...} where x < z and y > t or x > z and y < t. Capturing is a weaker condition than nesting, so for example {{1,3,5},{2,4}} is capturing but not nesting."
