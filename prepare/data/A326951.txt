        "Alternatively, these are unlabeled sets of subsets of {1..n} whose dual is a (strict) antichain, also called T_1 sets of subsets. The dual of a set of subsets has, for each vertex, one edge consisting of the indices (or positions) of the edges containing that vertex. An antichain is a set of subsets where no edge is a subset of any other."
