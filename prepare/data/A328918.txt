        "Published with slightly different wording in Mathematics Magazine, Problem 1016, Dec. 1977.",
        "Analyzed for n = 1, 2, 3; computer-verified for n up to 8.",
        "All solutions consist of an even number of digits followed by the digit 5 followed by zero or more 0's. This pattern means that a(2*n-1) = a(2*n). The initial segment consists of pairs of digits that add to 9 (0 with 9, 1 with 8, etc) arranged in arbitrary order and in particular leading 0's are permitted by the definition of the problem. A287317(k) gives the number of such arrangement with k pairs. For example, 339606500 + 660393500 is a solution. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Nov 03 2019"
