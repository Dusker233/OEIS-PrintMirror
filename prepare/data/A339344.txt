        "Given a set of prime numbers P, finite or infinite, the set of numbers which are divisible by at least one of the primes in P has an asymptotic density Product_{p in P} (1 - 1/p). If P is finite, then this density is equal to 1/2 only when P = {2}. Otherwise, the density is 1/2 for infinitely many sets P. This sequence is the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of such primes.",
