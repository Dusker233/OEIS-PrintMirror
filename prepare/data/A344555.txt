For example, if number ends in 8, the last digit of the square of k will always be 4, the last digit of the cube of k will always be 2, the last digit of the fourth power of k will always be 6, and the fifth power of k will always be 8.  Base numbers that end in 0, 1, 5, and 6 will always result in numbers with the same digit when they have positive integers as exponents.  For k that have a 2 in the ones place, then the square of k will have 4 in the ones place, the cube of k will have 8 in the ones place, the fourth power of k will have 6 in the ones place, and the fifth power of k will have 2 in the ones place.",

        "The patterns that I have noticed and seen confirmed demonstrate that the infinite patterns that result with the end digits of exponents when n has a particular numerical value from k^2, k^3, k^4, and k^5 before they repeat are as follows: k with final digit 0 (0000); k with final digit 1 (1111); k with final digit 2 (4862); k with final digit 3 (9713); k with final digit 4 (6464); k with final digit 5 (5555); k with final digit 6 (6666); k with final digit 7 (9317); k with final digit 8 (4268); and k with final digit 9 (1919).",

The 4862 sequence among the final digits of the power for 4862 then continues infinitely as 4862^6 ends in 4, 4862^7 ends in 8, 4862^8 ends in 6), 4862 ends in 2, and so on.",
