        "a(n) is the maximum value of the nearest neighbor interchange distance between two unrooted binary trees with n leaves, obtained by evaluating the distance from one tree with each of the unlabeled n-leaf tree shapes (see A000672) to each labeled n-leaf tree (A001147) using the C script described in Li et al. (1996).",
        "The known terms a(3),...,a(12) happen (coincidentally?) to match the first ten terms of A211266. However, it seems unlikely that the sequences will agree for ever."
