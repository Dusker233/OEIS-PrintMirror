    "comment": [
        "A pseudo-polytan is a planar figure consisting of n isosceles right triangles joined either edge-to-edge or corner-to-corner, in such a way that the short edges of the triangles coincide with edges of the square lattice. Two figures are considered equivalent if they differ only by a rotation or reflection.",
        "The pseudo-polytans are constructed in the same way as ordinary polytans (A006074), but allowing for corner-connections. Thus they generalize polytans in the same way that pseudo-polyominoes (aka polyplets, A030222) generalize ordinary polyominoes (A000105)."

        "a(2) = 10, because there are 10 ways of adjoining two isosceles right triangles: 3 distinct edge-to-edge joins (cf. A006074), and 7 distinct corner-to-corner joins."
