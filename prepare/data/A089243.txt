    "comment": [
        "A \"stroke\" is defined as follows. If the following conditions are satisfied then the partition to directed paths on a directed graph is called \"a partition to strokes on a directed graph\", and all directed paths in the partition are called \"strokes\". C.1. Two different directed paths in a partition do not have the same edges. C.2. A union of two different paths in a partition does not become a directed path. In other words, a \"stroke\" is a locally maximal path on a directed graph.",
        "This sequence has its origin in the strokes made when writing Japanese Kanji.",
        "The value a(1) is ambiguous as it depends on the definition of the star graph with n = 1 edge. If one of the edge endpoints is labeled as the star center, then we have the current value a(1) = 2. However, if the center is not distinguished, then a(1) would be 1. - _Max Alekseyev_, May 04 2023"
