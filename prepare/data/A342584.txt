        "Let s(k) be the sum of the first k terms of the Leibniz series, and let eps(k) = |Pi-floor(Pi*10^(k-1))/10^(k-1)|. Then a(n) is either the minimum k such that |Pi-s(k)| < Min(eps(n), 1/10^(n-1)-eps(n)), or one less than the minimum such k.",
        "a(n) is the minimum k such that the k-th and k+1-th partial sums agree with Pi in the first n decimal digits.",
        "It is easy to calculate a(n) for large n because the partial sums of the Leibniz series can be expressed in terms of the digamma function, which can be computed efficiently using an asymptotic series."
