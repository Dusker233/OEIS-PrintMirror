        "The following algorithm will generate all numbers k such that the digits of k^(1/b) begins with k: For each integer m >= 0, compute r = floor(10^(bm/(b-1)). Let s <= r be the largest integer >= 0 such that (r-s)*10^(bm) < (r-s+1)^b. Then r, r-1, ... r-s are such numbers k and there are no other such numbers."
