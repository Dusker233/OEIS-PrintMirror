The doubled numbers are the positions of the letter \"c\" in the tribonacci word (A003146). Correspondingly, the tripled numbers are positions of letters \"a\" and \"b\" in the tribonacci word.",

Then its tribonacci successor n_2 has tribonacci representation t0 (such numbers are in column 2 of the Trithoff array), and the successor of the successor n_3 has tribonacci representation t00 (such numbers are in column 3 of the Trithoff array). The pre-seed in the same row as n_1, n_2, and n_3 is 2n_1-n_2."
