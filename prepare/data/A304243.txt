        "The primes to insert are 2 (in front) or 5, 7, 11, 13, ... after the number's first, second, third, ... digit. So there cannot be any 1 digit solution because if 5 is appended this cannot yield a prime. One can show that the terms cannnot have more than 21 digits.",
        "The prime 3 is excluded from the strings to insert, because else no term could have more than 2 digits: to be prime with 2 prefixed or with 3 inserted, the number must be congruent to 2 (mod 3), so it cannot be prime with 7 appended or inserted. See also the Rivera link and A304244."
