        "Odd orders of finite abelian groups that appear as the group of units in a commutative ring (Chebolu and Lockridge, see A296241). - _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 15 2017",
        "Actually, the Chebolu and Lockridge paper states that this sequence gives all odd numbers that are possible numbers of units in a (commutative or non-commutative) ring (Ditor's theorem). Concretely, if k = (2^(e_1)-1)*(2^(e_2)-1)*...(2^(e_r)-1) is a term, let R = (F_2)^s X F_(2^(e_1)) X F_(2^(e_2)) X ... X F_(2^(e_r)) for s >= 0, then the number of units in R is k. - _Jianing Song_, Dec 23 2021"
