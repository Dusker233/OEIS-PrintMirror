    "comment": [
        "There are two places in R. W. Floyd's modified algorithm where the keys are compared. The first is in step H4 [Find larger child.] and the second in step H9' [Does K fit?]. The sequence shows the maxima of the counts of these comparisons, determined over all n! possible orders of the records."
