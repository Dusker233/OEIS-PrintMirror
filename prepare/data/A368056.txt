        "Every power of 2 appears in this sequence, as for any positive integer n, adjoining a primitive 2^(n+1)-th root of unity to Q yields a degree 2^n number field unramified away from 2.",
        "The first example of an odd degree number field unramified away from 2 is the degree 17 number field Q(a) where a is a root of the polynomial x^17 - 2x^16 + 8x^13 + 16x^12 - 16x^11 + 64x^9 - 32x^8 - 80x^7 + 32x^6 + 40x^5 + 80x^4 + 16x^3 - 128x^2 - 2x + 68, found by David Harbater."
