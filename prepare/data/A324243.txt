        "Rotkiewicz defined these numbers and found the first 6 terms that are semiprimes (6, 14, 15, 35, 65, 119, and 377).",
        "K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek et al. named these numbers Rotkiewicz numbers, and proved that the following criteria are equivalent to the definition:",
        "1) Numbers k such that c^sigma(k) == 1 (mod k) for all numbers c such that gcd(c, k) = 1.",
        "2) Numbers k such that lambda(k) | sigma(k) where lambda is the Carmichael lambda function (A002322).",
        "They also proved that:",
        "1) If M(p) = 2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime (A000668) then 2^(p-2)*M(p) is a term.",
        "2) If n is a term and, 2^k is the largest power of 2 that divides sigma(n), and F(m) = 2^(2^m) + 1 is a Fermat prime not dividing n such that m <= log_2(k+1) then n*F(m) is also a term."
