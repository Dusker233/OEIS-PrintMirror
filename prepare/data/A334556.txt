        "An XOR-triangle is an inverted 0-1 triangle formed by choosing a top row and having each entry in the subsequent rows be the XOR of the two values above it.",
        "If n is in the sequence, then so is A030101(n), the binary reversal of n.",
        "All positive terms are odd because each side must begin with (and therefore end with) a 1.",
        "The number of terms with a given binary length (A070939) is either 0 or a power of 2. This is because the \"all sides are equal\" property is equivalent to being the solution to a system of linear equations over the field of integers modulo 2.",
        "If x, y, and z are in the sequence and have the same binary length, then x XOR y XOR z is also in the sequence, where XOR is the nim sum (A003987).",
        "The second row in triangle has binary expansion given by A038554.",
        "The resemblance to 1D CA stems from that it's the same rule as \"Rule 90\", aka \"Pascal's triangle reduced modulo 2\" aka Sierpinski Gasket. - _Antti Karttunen_ May 06 2020"
