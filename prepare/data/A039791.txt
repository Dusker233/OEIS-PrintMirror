        "Number of bit strings of length L = 2n+1 and Hamming weight n (or n+1, as generated by Fletcher et al.) up to chord equivalence (i.e., up to color and general linear permutation x -> Ax+b mod L for A on Z/LZ* and b on Z/LZ--essentially a multiplicative necklace of phi(L) additive necklaces of L black and white beads where L is odd and the colors are as balanced as possible). The same strings are counted up to bracelet equivalence (x -> +-x+b mod L) at A007123, up to necklace equivalence (x -> x+b mod L) at A000108, and in full (x -> x) at A001700. - _Travis Scott_, Nov 24 2022"
