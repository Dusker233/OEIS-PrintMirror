        "Two integers are isospectral if they have the same spectral basis. An isospectral chain of length n is a sequence N1,...,Nn of integers with the same spectral basis such that N1=2*N2=...=n*Nn and index(Nk)=k. A chain is maximal if it cannot be extended to an isospectral chain of length n+1.",
