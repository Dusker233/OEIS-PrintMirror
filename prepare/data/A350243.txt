        "These are polyominoes of the regular tiling with Schl\u00e4fli symbol {6,3}. Each has a symmetry group of order 6. This sequence along with five others and A001207 can be used to determine A006535, the number of oriented polyominoes of the {6,3} regular tiling.",
        "The sequence is calculated by using Redelmeier's method to generate fixed polyominoes, which are then mapped to one or two of the symmetric polyominoes as shown in the attachment."
