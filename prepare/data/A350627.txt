        "Start with an infinite square grid. Each cell has eight neighbors. Place the numbers 1, 2, ..., n anywhere. Now place the numbers n+1, n+2, ..., m in order, subject to the rule that when you place k, the sum of its neighbors must equal k. Then a(n) is the maximum m that can be achieved.",
        "This is similar to the Stepping Stones problem discussed in A337663, but predates it by more than 20 years.",
        "As can be seen in the El Acertijo (The Riddle) links and in _Rodolfo Kurchan_'s webpage, there are at least six similar problems, for example when the numbers are restricted to an n X n square board. All of these are worthy of inclusion in the OEIS once enough terms are known."
