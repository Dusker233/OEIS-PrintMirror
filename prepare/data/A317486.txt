        "In the n-Bruhat graph, 6-cycles can be of three types: 1) those that move only three adjacent points of the permutation, 2) those that move five points with two being adjacent and the other three being adjacent, 3) those that move a total of six points consisting of three pairs of adjacent points. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jul 31 2018"
