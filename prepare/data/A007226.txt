        "\"A punctured convolutional code is a high-rate code obtained by the periodic elimination (i.e., puncturing) of specific code symbols from the output of a low-rate encoder. The resulting high-rate code depends on both the low-rate code, called the original code, and the number and specific positions of the punctured symbols.\" (The quote is from Haccoun and B\u00e9gin (1989).)",
        "A high-rate code (v,b) (written as R = b/v) can be constructed from a low-rate code (v0,1) (written as R = 1/v0) by deleting from every v0*b code symbols a number of v0*b - v symbols (so that the resulting rate is R = b/v).",
        "Even though my formulas below do not appear in the two published papers in the IEEE Transactions on Communications, from the theory in those two papers, it makes sense to replace \"k|b\" with \"k|v0*b\" (and \"k|gcd(v,b)\" with \"k|gcd(v,v0*b)\"). Pab Ter, however, uses \"k|b\" in the Maple programs in the related sequences A007223, A007224, A007225, A007227, and A007229. (End)",
