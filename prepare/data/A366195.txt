        "These are numbers whose binary expansion corresponds to an invalid prefix of a Lyndon word on a two-letter alphabet. If the alphabet is {x, y}, where x < y, then taking the binary expansion of a(n) and mapping 1 to x and 0 to y results in a string that is not a prefix to any Lyndon word. Moreover, this sequence enumerates all strings starting with x that are not prefixes of Lyndon words on this alphabet.",
