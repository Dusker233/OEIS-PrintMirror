        "For n>=3, a(n) is the number of topological configurations (up to cyclic shifts and reversal) of n points and n lines, where the points lie at the vertices of a convex cyclic n-gon and the lines are the perpendicular bisectors of its sides. Counting such configurations without quotienting out by cyclic shifts and reversal gives the sequence A028243.",
        "a(n) is also the number of equivalence classes (up to cyclic shifts and reversal) of 2n-tuples composed of n 0's and n 1's which have an interlacing signature. The signature of a 2n-tuple (v_1,...,v_{2n}) is the n-tuple (s_1,...,s_n) defined by s_i=v_i+v_{i+n}. The signature is called interlacing if after deleting the 1's, there are letters remaining and the remaining 0's and 2's are alternating."
