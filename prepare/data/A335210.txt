Here v_p(x) is the p-adic valuation of x and H(L) is the L-th harmonic number. See also the sequences A268112, A335189, and A335207.",

The first few numbers L for which v_p(H'(L) - 1) = 2 (rather than 1) for some p <= L are 1501, 4596, and 9367 with corresponding p equal to 7, 19, and 37, respectively."
