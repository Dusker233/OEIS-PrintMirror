        "For every prime gap g, there is a run of consecutive a(n) of length max{[(g+2)/6]-1,0}.",
        "Gaps between successive a(n) correspond to clusters of primes all within +- 8 of each other.  The number of primes within a gap G = a(n+1) - a(n) ranges from (G/6 - 1) to (G/6 - 1) plus the number of twin primes within the gap.",
        "Record gaps in a(n) are 24 at a(1)=120, 42 at a(2)=144, 72 at a(10)=342 and 84 at a(1003)=14706 (the next gaps of 84 occur at a(43136164)=369008652 and a(643519601)=5244999552).  No larger record gaps exist below 10^10 (n <= 1239026836).",

        "Define a \"small-gap k-tuple\" to be an admissible k-tuple with all of its gaps in {2,4,6,8}.  Every gap G = a(n+1) - a(n) >= 18 contains a small-gap k-tuple with k >= G/6 - 1 and diameter G-14, G-12 or G-10.  For example, at n=40 the gap between 1080 and 1134 contains the 9-tuple p+{0,4,6,10,16,22,30,36,42} for p=1087. - _Brian Almond_, Jul 25 2020"
