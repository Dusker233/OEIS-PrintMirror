    "comment": [
        "The terms are consecutive septuples, ordered so that (A) a(7i-6) < a(7i-5) < ... < a(7i) for i > 0, and (B) a(7i+1) < a(7i+8) for i >= 0.  This sequence has primitive solutions only.  If k is relatively prime to all of the terms in a primitive septuple, then multiplying the terms in that septuple by k gives another solution - see A322683."
