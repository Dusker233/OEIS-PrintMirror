        "Let R_s be the reduced Collatz sequence starting with s and let R_s(i), i >= 0 be the i-th term in R_s. Then any term in R_s can be described as (3*s^i + k)/2^j, where j is the total number of halving steps from R_s(0) to R_s(i) i >= 1, and k is some term in A116641. k=1 when i=1; when i > 1, k is determined by the specific order of halving steps in R_s.",

        "3. Let 2^y be the summand used to find terms (t) in any previously-generated subsequence. (For instance, in m=2, b(3)=53: y=5 because t=53 = 3*7 + 32.) Continue generating new subsequences p(q) = 3*t + 2^(y+z) {z=1..inf} for all t. So in this example, from t=53 we get p(q) = 3*53 + {64,128,256,512,...} = {223,287,415,671,...}; from t=671 we get p(q) = 3*671 + {1024,2048,4096,...} = {3037,4061,6109,...), etc.",
