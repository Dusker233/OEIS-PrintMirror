        "The first 300 terms of this sequence are such that m and m+1 both have exactly 7 prime divisors. See A321497 for the terms m such that m or m+1 has more than 7 prime factors: the smallest such term is 5163068910.",
        "Numbers m and m+1 can never have a common prime factor (consider them mod p), therefore the terms are > sqrt(p(7+7)#) = A003059(A002110(7+7)). (Here we see that sqrt(p(7+8)#) is a more realistic estimate of a(1), but for smaller values of k we may have sqrt(p(2k+1)#) > m(k) > sqrt(p(2k)#), where m(k) is the smallest of two consecutive integers each having at least k prime divisors. For example, A321503(1) < sqrt(p(3+4)#) ~ A321493(1).)",

An example of a term that is a multiple of 210 but not in A321497 is 29759526510, due to _Charles R Greathouse IV_. Such examples can be constructed by solving A*210 + 1 = B for A having 3 distinct prime factors not among {2, 3, 5, 7}, B having 7 distinct prime factors and gcd(B, 210*A) = 1. (End)"
