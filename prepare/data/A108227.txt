        "If we replace \"abundant\" in the definition with \"non-deficient\", we get the same sequence with an initial 2 instead of 3, barring an astronomically unlikely coincidence with some as-yet-undiscovered odd perfect number. [This is sequence A107705. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 14 2017]",
        "It appears that all terms >= 5 correspond to the odd primitive abundant numbers (A006038) which are products of consecutive primes (cf. A285993), i.e., of the form N = Product_{0<=i<r} prime(n+i) for some r, which turns out to be r = a(n). - _M. F. Hasler_, May 08 2017",
        "From _Jianing Song_, Apr 21 2021: (Start)",
        "Let x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_k < ... be the numbers of the form p of p^2 + p, where p is a prime >= prime(n). Then a(n) is the smallest N such that Product_{i=1..N} (1 + 1/x_i) > 2. See my link below for a proof.",
        "For example, for n = 3, we have {x_1, x_2, ..., x_k, ...} = {5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 5^2 + 5, ...}, we have Product_{i=1..8} (1 + 1/x_i) < 2 and Product_{i=1..9} (1 + 1/x_i) > 2, so a(3) = 9. (End)"
