        "The partitions into even parts, encoded by their Heinz numbers. We define the Heinz number of a partition p = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_r] as Product(p_j-th prime, j=1..r) (concept used by _Alois P. Heinz_ in A215366 as an \"encoding\" of a partition). For example, for the partition [1, 1, 2, 4, 10] we get 2*2*3*7*29 = 2436. Example: 63 ( = 3*3*7) is in the sequence because it is the Heinz number of the partition [2, 2, 4]. - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 19 2015",
