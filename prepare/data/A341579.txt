    "comment": [
        "Scorer, Grundy and Smith define a variation of the towers of Hanoi puzzle where the smallest disk moves freely and two disks can exchange positions when they differ in size by 1, are on different pegs, and each is topmost on its peg.  The aim is to move a stack of n disks from one peg to another.",
        "Stockmeyer et al. show that the number of steps in the solution is a(n), and that the sequence of steps is unique.  They offer as exercises for the reader to prove that the number of exchanges with the solution is a(n-1), and that a(n) is the largest number of steps between any two configurations (in other words, a(n) is the diameter of the state graph)."
