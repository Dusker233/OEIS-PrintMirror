        "In hailstone sequences, only even powers of 2 are obtained as a final peak before descending to 1. [I assume this should really say: \"These are numbers whose 3x+1 trajectory has the property that the final peak before descending to 1 is an even power of 2.\" - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 22 2020]",
