        "Conjecture: if n is a Carmichael number and lpf(n)gpf(n)(lpf(n)+gpf(n))/2 = n, then (lpf(n)+gpf(n))/2 is prime; and thus n has exactly three prime factors. Such numbers n form a proper subsequence of this sequence, also subsequence of A262723. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_ and _Thomas Ordowski_, Mar 17 2018. Edited by _Max Alekseyev_, Mar 17 2018",
        "Proof of the above conjecture: Say n = paq with 2 < p < q being primes and a = (p+q)/2, with (a,p!)=1. If n is a Carmichael number, then pa == 1 (mod q-1), so p^2 + pq == 2 (mod q-1), so p^2 + p == 2 (mod q-1). In particular, p^2 + p - 2 >= q-1, which implies that (p+1)^2 > q. Say a has k prime factors, so that a >= (p+2)^k. But a < q, so q > (p+2)^k. Thus, (p+1)^2 > q > (p+2)^k. This implies k=1. - Carl Pomerance (in a letter to the second author), Mar 18 2018",
        "Note: this does not exclude the existence of the Carmichael numbers m = pq(p+q)/2 with more than three prime factors, where p and q are prime. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Mar 19 2018"
