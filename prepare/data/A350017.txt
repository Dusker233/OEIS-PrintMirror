    "comment": [
        "Isotopism classes are obtained by permuting rows, permuting columns and permuting symbols. There is a stronger notion of equivalence called \"species\" (also known as main classes and paratopism classes). For this particular problem the counts for species equal the counts for isotopism classes."
