        "For D=13, the least positive y for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is 1. The next prime, D, for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is 61, but the smallest positive y in this case is also 1, which is equal to the previous record y. So, 61 is not a term.",
        "The next prime, D, after 13 for which x^2-D*y^2=3 has a solution is 73 and the least positive y for which it has a solution is y=11, which is larger than 1, so it is a new record y value. So, 73 is a term of A336796 and 11 is a term of this sequence."
