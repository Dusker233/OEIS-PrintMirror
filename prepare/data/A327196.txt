        "A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges. The non-spanning edge-connectivity of a set-system is the minimum number of edges that must be removed (along with any non-covered vertices) to obtain a disconnected or empty set-system."
