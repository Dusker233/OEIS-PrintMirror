        "A module in a (simple, undirected) graph is a subset S of vertices that are \"externally indistinguishable\" in the following sense: for all v_1, v_2 in S and v outside of S, v either has an edge to both v1 or v2, or it has an edge to neither of them. a(n) is the number of graphs where the only such modules S are the empty set, the singleton vertices, and the entire set of vertices.",
