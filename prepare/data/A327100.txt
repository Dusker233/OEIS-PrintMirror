        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system (finite set of finite nonempty sets) has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.",
        "We define the cut-connectivity of a set-system to be the minimum number of vertices that must be removed (along with any resulting empty edges) to obtain a disconnected or empty set-system, with the exception that a set-system with one vertex has cut-connectivity 1. Except for cointersecting set-systems (A326853, A327039, A327040), this is the same as vertex-connectivity (A327334, A327051)."
