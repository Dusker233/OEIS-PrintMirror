        "This sequence is finite and a(7) = 14 is the last term. Nagura (see references) proves that for n >= 25, there is always a prime between n and 1.2*n. Hence, for any prime p > 25, there is always a number m between 4p and 4.8*p, and so floor(m/p) = 4. Since by assumption p > 4, floor(floor(m/p)/p) = 0 and so m! is divisible by p^4 but not p^5. It remains to check the primes up to 25 individually. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 14 2020"
