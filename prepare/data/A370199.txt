        "Whether a polyomino is \"odd\" is determined by the fact that the permutation defined by assigning the positions from row- or column-wise enumeration of its cells on a square grid is an odd permutation. See the description in the 'Ponder This' challenge for the exact definition.",
        "The terms a(1)-a(10) were given in this description, and a(11)-a(20) were in the solution. The larger terms are results of the program that the user \"uau\" provided in the Mersenne forum."
