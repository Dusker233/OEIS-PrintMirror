        "Number of terms in interval [2^(n-1), 2^n) is the number of compositions of n with distinct parts (cf. A032020). For example, if n=6, then interval [2^5, 2^6) contains  11 terms {32,...,52}. This corresponds to 11 compositions with distinct parts of 6: 6, 5+1, 1+5, 4+2, 2+4, 3+2+1, 3+1+2, 2+3+1, 2+1+3, 1+3+2, 1+2+3.",
