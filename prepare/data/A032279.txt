Gupta (1979); I gave a short proof of Gupta's result and showed an equivalence of this problem and every one of the following problems: enumerating the bracelets of n beads of 2 colors, k of them black, and enumerating the necklaces of k beads each of them painted by one of n colors.",

        "Let (c(n): n >= 1) be a sequence of nonnegative integers and let C(x) = Sum_{n>=1} c(n)*x^n be its g.f. Let k be a positive integer. Let a_k = (a_k(n): n >= 1) be the output sequence of the DIK[k] transform of sequence (c(n): n >= 1), and let A_k(x) = Sum_{n>=1} a_k(n)*x^n be its g.f. See _Christian G. Bower_'s web link below. It can be proved that, when k is odd, A_k(x) = ((1/k)*Sum_{d|k} phi(d)*C(x^d)^(k/d) + C(x^2)^((k-1)/2)*C(x))/2.",
        "For this sequence, k = 5, c(n) = 1 for all n >= 1, and C(x) = x/(1-x). Thus, a(n) = a_5(n) for all n >= 1. Since a_k(n) = 0  for 1 <= n <= k-1, the offset of this sequence is n = k = 5. Applying the formula for the g.f. of DIK[5] of (c(n): n >= 1) with C(x) = x/(1-x) and k = 5, we get A(x) = A_5(x) = x^5*((1/5)*Sum_{d|5} phi(d)*(1-x^d)^(-5/d) + (1+x)/(1-x^2)^3)/2, which obviously equals the g.f. in the formula section below.",
        "The g.f. is also a special case of _Herbert Kociemba_'s formula that is valid for both even and odd k: A_k(x) = x^k*((1/k)*Sum_{d|k} phi(d)*(1-x^d)^(-k/d) + (1+x)/(1-x^2)^Floor[(k+2)/2])/2.",
        "Here, a(n) is defined to be the number of n-bead bracelets of two colors with 5 black beads and n-5 white beads. But it is also the number of dihedral compositions of n with 5 positive parts. (This statement is equivalent to _Vladimir Shevelev_'s statement above that a(n) is the \"number of non-equivalent necklaces of 5 beads each of them painted by one of n colors.\" By \"necklaces\" he means \"turnover necklaces\". See paragraph (2) of Section 2 in his 2004 paper in the Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics.)",
