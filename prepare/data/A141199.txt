    "comment": [
        "Consider the \"ordered partitions of partitions\" as described in A055887. They are produced by introducing separators (a term used by J. Riordan) between the parts of a partition. If a partition has P parts, then it is possible to introduce 1, 2, ... P-1 separators. Let \"|\" denote such a separator. We just append 1,2,...,P-1 separators to each integer partition of n and subsequently form all permutation of the resulting list (which is composed of parts and separators).",
        "There are some rules: If we do not append a separator, then we do not perform any permutation. Furthermore, we do not accept permutations which have a dangling separator in front of the integer parts or past them. E.g. the permutations [|,1,2,3] and [1,2,3,|] are forbidden. Furthermore, sequences of separators as \"|,|\" are forbidden.",
        "Now we impose a further restriction on the permutations. Consider the elements between two separators. We call their number \"occupation number\". We just request that the occupation number of a ordered partition is monotonically decreasing (if we start from the left to the right of a permutation written in our notation). If we interpret a separator as a level, then we can speak of a hierarchy. E.g. we do not count [1,|,2,3,|,4] as a hierarchy, but we accept [1,2|,3,4] as a hierarchy. We thus speak of \"hierarchically ordered partitions of partitions\" for this sequence.",
        "With the generating function f := z -> 1/(mul(1-z^i/mul(1-z^j,j=1..i), i=1..25)); we get the asymptotc expansion using the command equivalent (f(z),z,n);",
        "The result is 3.788561346*exp(-n)^(-log(2)) + O(1/n*exp(-n)^(-log(2))). Let fas := n -> 3.788562346*exp(-n)^(-log(2)); then for n=60 we get fas(60)/A141199(60)= .4367915009e19/4344507472742893655 = 1.005387846.",
        "In short, a(n) is the number of finite sequences of integer partitions with weakly decreasing lengths and total sum n. The case of twice-partitions is A358831. A version choosing compositions is A218482. The strictly decreasing case is A358836. For ordered set partitions we have A005651.
