    "comment": [
        "The analogous sequence for numbers of graphs on n labeled nodes such that each node participates in exactly one maximal clique is the Bell numbers: A000110. The sequence for numbers of graphs on n labeled nodes is A006125.",
        "We provide MATLAB code generating for any fixed n a sequence of \"M(n,m) = number of graphs on n labeled nodes such that each node participates in no more than m maximal cliques\".",
        "For any fixed n we know the range of m: from 1 to ksi(n), such that M(n,ksi(n)) = M(n,ksi(n)+k) = 2^(n(n-1)/2) for any natural k (2^(n(n-1)/2) -- number of graphs on n labeled nodes). And M(n,ksi(n)-k) < M(n,ksi(n)) for any natural k<ksi(n).",
        "(Unlabeled) graphs where each node participates in no more than two maximal cliques are called domino graphs. They can be characterized as (W4,claw,gem)-free graphs [see Kloks et al.]. - _Falk H\u00fcffner_, Jun 17 2018"
