        "Suppose we look for terms below (inclusive) u. Let maxp be the largest prime factor that is the multiple of at least one of those terms. Then maxp is the largest prime below (inclusive) u^(1/5).",
        "Proof: The sum of prime factors counted with multiplicity of a term t divisible by maxp is 5*maxp. The smallest product of primes summing to 5*maxp where the largest prime factor of t is maxp is maxp^5 which must be <= u. Solving this gives maxp is the largest prime below (inclusive) u^(1/5).",
