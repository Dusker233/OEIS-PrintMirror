        "A man and a woman who rank each other last and end up in a marriage are called a hell-couple. A stable matching cannot have more than one hell-couple.",

        "The Gale-Shapley algorithm (both men-proposing and women-proposing) for such a profile needs at least n rounds to terminate.",

        "This sequence is distinct from A344670 because in this sequence profiles are counted with their respective multiplicity if they yield multiple stable matchings with a hell-couple."
