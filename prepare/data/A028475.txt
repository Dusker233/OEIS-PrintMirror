        "An algorithm for calculating these numbers is known. 2*a(n) can be interpreted as the number of pairs of non-intersecting arch configurations (over and under a straight line) connecting 2n points in the line, where all points are marked + and - alternately, every point belongs to a unique arch and the ends of every arch have different signs."

There are 3 rooted cubic bipartite planar maps with 4 nodes: a quadrangular with two non-adjacent edges doubled (parallel), where one vertex and any of the edges incident to it are taken as the root. No Hamiltonian cycle can avoid the sole edge incident to the root-vertex. For the other two rootings, there are 4 root-edge avoiding Hamiltonian cycles. So a(2)=4."
