        "Quoting from p. 59 in Cyvin et al. (1997): \"When an octagon is rooted at an edge ... then either (a) one branch can be attached in five directions at a time, (b) two branches can be attached in six ways, or (c) three branches in one way. Let the numbers of these kinds of systems be denoted by (a) U_r^*, (b) U_r^{**}, and (c) U_r^{***}, respectively.\"",
        "Here r is \"the number of octagons or eight-membered rings\" in an edge-rooted catapolygon (here, catapolyoctagon). A catapolyoctagon is a \"catacondensed polygonal system consisting of octagons\" (where \"catacondensed\" means it has no internal vertices).",
        "On p. 59 in Cyvin et al. (1997), the total number of edge-rooted catapolyoctagons (each with r octagons) is denoted by U_r, and we have U_r = U_r^* + U_r^{**} + U_r^{***} for r >= 2.",
        "We have U_r = A036758(r), U_r^* = a(r) (current sequence), U_r^{**} = A121113(r), and U_r^{***} = A121114(r) for r >= 1.",
        "For the current sequence, we have a(r) = U_r^* = 5*U_{r-1} = 5*A036758(r-1) for r >= 2 with a(1) = U_1^* = 0.",
        "The ultimate purpose of these calculations (in the paper by Cyvin et al. (1997)) is the calculation of I_r = A036760(r), which is the \"number of nonisomorphic free (unrooted) catapolyoctagons when r is given.\" These catapolyoctagons \"represent a class of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons, C_{6r+2} H_{4r+4}\" (see p. 57 in Cyvin et al.
