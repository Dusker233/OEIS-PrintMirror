        "Suppose that p = x(1) >= x(2) >= ... >= x(k) is a partition of n. Let y(1) > y(2) > ... > y(h) be the distinct parts of p, and let m(i) be the multiplicity of y(i) for 1 <= i <= h. Then we can \"look\" at p as \"m(1) y(1)'s and m(2) y(2)'s and ... m(h) y(h)'s\". Reversing the m's and y's, we can then \"say\" the Look-and-Say partition of p, denoted by LS(p). The name \"Look-and-Say\" follows the example of Look-and-Say integer sequences (e.g., A005150). As p ranges through the partitions of n, LS(p) ranges through all the Look-and-Say partitions of n. The number of these is A239455(n).",
        "The Look-and-Say array is distinct from the Wilf array, described at A098859; for example, the number of Look-and-Say partitions of 9 is A239455(9) = 16, whereas the number of Wilf partitions of 9 is A098859(9) = 15. The Look-and-Say partition of 9 which is not a Wilf partition of 9 is [2,2,2,1,1,1].",
        "Theorem: a partition is Look-and-Say iff it has a permutation with all distinct run-lengths. For example, the partition y = (2,2,2,1,1,1) has the permutation (2,2,1,1,1,2), with run-lengths (2,3,1), which are all distinct, so y is counted under a(9). - _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 17 2022"
