        "When implementing the men-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm on such a preference profile, woman number 1's first engagement comes in an earlier round than the first engagement of woman number 2. Similarly, when implementing the women-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm on such a preference profile, man number 1's first engagement comes in an earlier round than the first engagement for man number 2."
