        "The graphs on the complex plane (see links) show the Gaussian primes mapped and connected by lines in the order in which their indices appear in {a(n)}. The numbers in base -1+i tile the complex plane in the twin dragon fractal pattern, and the Gaussian primes are numerous such that the fractal is still discernible.",
        "The only even terms are 2, 6, 14, and 58, since even terms correspond to Gaussian integers divisible by -1+i, and the base-(-1+i) expansions of -1+i, -1-i, 1+i, and 1-i are 10, 110, 1110, and 111010 respectively. - _Jianing Song_, Oct 02 2022"
