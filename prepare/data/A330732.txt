        "The hailstone (Collatz) sequence of a number is defined by repeated operations of f(x), where f(x)=x/2 if x is even, and f(x)=3x+1 if x is odd. The odd numbers of a number's hailstone sequence are also called its odd hailstone sequence.",

        "Note that a(n+1) isn't necessarily greater than a(n)."
