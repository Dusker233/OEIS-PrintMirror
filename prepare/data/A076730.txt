        "See sequence A134596 for the least numbers of given length which yields these maxima over n-digit indices for A039993. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 11 2014",
        "By definition this is a subsequence of A076497. The term a(10) was incorrectly given as 398100 = A075053(1123456789), which double-counts each prime using only one digit '1'. But a(10) = A039993(1123456789) = A076497(80) = 362451. The values given for a(9) and a(11) were also incorrect, the latter probably for the same reason, and for a(9) probably due to double-counting of primes with leading zeros. - _M. F. Hasler_ and _David A. Corneth_, Oct 15 2019"
