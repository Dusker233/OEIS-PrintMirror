        "A309132(m) divides m for all Carmichael numbers m, but apparently most of them equal A309132(m). Of the first 10000 Carmichael numbers, only 1341 are in this sequence.",

        "By _Jonathan Sondow_'s theorem (cf. comments in A309132), these are Carmichael numbers m such that denominator(Sum_{prime p|m}1/p - 1/m) < m, i.e., A326690(m) < m.",
        "Problem: are there Carmichael numbers m such that A309132(m) is prime? Equivalently, Carmichael numbers m such that A326690(m) is prime. None exist below 2^64. Conjecture: there are no such Carmichael numbers."
