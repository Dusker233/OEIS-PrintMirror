        "We place the k digits of a number in succession in k adjacent square boxes forming a rectangle of base k and height 1. We can only place a vertical blade under this rectangle in two ways: exactly between two boxes [positions (a) and (d) below)] or exactly under the middle of a box [position (b) and (c) below)].",
        "If the blade is placed in position (a) between the two 1s of 11, the number 11 is stable.",
        "If the blade is placed in (b) exactly under the 0 of 101, the number 101 is stable.",
        "If the blade is placed in (c) exactly under the 1 of 10, the number is stable.",
        "If the blade is placed in (d) between the 0 and the 2 of 102, the number 102 is stable.",
        "For the last two examples, the balance of the number considered can be explained as follows: the distance which separates a digit from the blade comes into play - the more this distance increases, the heavier the digit in question is. So, the digit 1 of 102 weighs 2 in reality (weight*distance = 1*2 = 2). This quantity balances the influence of the 2 of 102 (for which weight*distance = 2*1 = 2 too).",
