        "The sequence is infinite. For example, all numbers of the form ((10^n-1)/9)*(10^2)+24 are terms for n > 0. The numbers of this form will never be divisible by 8 but they will always be divisible by 1, 2 and 4. Also there are infinitely many terms any three of whose consecutive digits are distinct, for example, concatenations of 124. Are there infinitely many terms which don't consist of periodically repeating substrings?  - _Metin Sariyar_, Jan 28 2021",
