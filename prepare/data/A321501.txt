        "Equivalently, numbers not of the form (x - y)^2*(x + y) or d^2*(2m + d), for (x, y) = (m+d, m). This shows that excluded are all squares d^2 > 0 times any number of the same parity and larger than d. In particular, for d=1, all odd numbers > 1, and for d=2, 4*(even numbers > 4) = 8*(odd numbers > 2). For larger d, no further (neither odd nor even) numbers are excluded.",
        "So apart from 0, 1 and 8, this consists of even numbers not multiple of 8. All these numbers occur, since for larger (odd or even) d, no additional term is excluded."
