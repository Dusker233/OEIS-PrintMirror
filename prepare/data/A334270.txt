        "Also the number of sequences of length n that cover an initial interval of positive integers and are both a Lyndon word and a reversed co-Lyndon word.",
        "A Lyndon word is a finite sequence of positive integers that is lexicographically strictly less than all of its cyclic rotations. Co-Lyndon is defined similarly, except with strictly greater instead of strictly less."
