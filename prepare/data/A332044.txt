    "comment": [
        "An n X n grid graph has a total of 2n(n-1) edges.  However, this results in 4n-8 odd vertices, which (except in the case of n=2) means an Eulerian circuit is not possible. Each side of the graph contains n-2 odd vertices.",
        "When n is even, these vertices can be separated into pairs, and the shortest postman circuit can be created using the edges between each pair twice.  This results in an increase of (n-2)/2 edges per side, or an increase of 2(n-2) total. When added to the total number of edges, this becomes 2n(n-1) + 2(n-2) = 2n^2-4.",
        "When n is odd, an even number of vertices per side can be separated into pairs, with the edge between them being used twice, just as before (resulting in an increase of (n-3)/2 edges per side, or an increase of 2(n-3) total).  However, this will leave four lone vertices - one per side. These can also be paired, and connected with two edges, for an additional 4 edges.  Adding all these edges together results in 2n(n-1) + 2(n-3) + 4 = 2n^2-2.",
        "The different forms for an even value of n and an odd value of n can be combined into a(n) = 2*n^2 - 4 + 2*(n mod 2)."
