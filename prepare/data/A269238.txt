        "Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions suggests that average gaps between primes of the form 10k + 7 below x are about phi(10)*log(x). This sequence shows that the record gap ending at p grows almost as fast as phi(10)*log^2(p). Here phi(n) is A000010, Euler's totient function; phi(10)=4.",
