        "The sequence is finite. Proof: for n=112, the sum is 2! + 3! + 5! + ... + 601! + 607! - 1, which is divisible by the next prime, 613. All the factorials of the subsequent primes 613!, 617!, ... are obviously divisible by 613. So after n=112 the sum will always be divisible by 613. And from n=26 to n=112 there are no other primes. So this sequence will not produce any other primes. - _Metin Sariyar_, Aug 26 2019"
