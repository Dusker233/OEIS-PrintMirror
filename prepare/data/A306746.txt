    "name": "A Goldbug number is an even number 2m for which there exists a subset of the prime non-divisors, P={p1, p2, p3, ..., pk}, of 2m where (2m-p1)*(2m-p2)*(2m-p3)*...*(2m-pk) has only elements of P as factors and one of the pi is between m/2 and m for even m and between (m+1)/2 and m-1 for odd m.",

        "A Goldbug number is an even number 2m for which there exists some subset of the prime non-divisors (PNDs) of 2m, 2 < p1 < p2 < p3 < ... < pk < m, such that (2m-p1)*(2m-p2)*(2m-p3)*...*(2m-pk) has only p1,p2,p3,...,pk as factors and one of the pi is between n/2 and n for even n and between (n+1)/2 and n-1 for odd n. We do not need to consider the case where n is prime, since then n itself is a Goldbach pair. A Goldbug number is called order k if the maximal subset satisfying the property is of size k. These numbers arise from Goldbug's Algorithm which attempts to find a Goldbach pair for a particular even number by starting with a given PND p1 and successively adding the factors of the product (2m - p1)*...*(2m - pk) to the search until a pair is found. Goldbug numbers are those even numbers for which Goldbug's Algorithm is not guaranteed to find a Goldbach pair since it could reach a subset of the PNDs which does not contain new information about additional PNDs to add to the search.",
        "Goldbug numbers are a special case of Basic Pipes as defined by Wu. It has been shown computationally a(7) > 5*10^8. See link.",
        "Goldbug numbers serve as a link between Goldbach's conjecture and the Pillai conjecture since order 2 Goldbug numbers represent solutions to its generalized difference equation. For example, sequence A057896 demonstrates there are no order 2 Goldbugs less than 10^24 since it would imply additional solutions to the equation a^x-a = b^y-b. In fact, theorem 3 from Scott[1993] implies that no additional order 2 Goldbugs exist at all."
