        "Every other base-3 digit must be strictly less than its neighbors. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 05 2018",
        "The terms can be generated in the following way: if A(n) are the terms with n digits in base 3, the terms with n+2 digits are obtained by prefixing them with '10' and with '20', and prefixing '21' to those starting with a digit '2'. It is easy to prove that #A(n) = A000045(n+2), since from the above we have #A(n+2) = 2*#A(n) + #A(n-1) = #A(n) + #A(n+1). (The #A(n-1) numbers starting with '2' are #A(n-2) numbers prefixed with '20' and #A(n-3) prefixed with '21'.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 05 2018"
