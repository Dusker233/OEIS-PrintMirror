        "The balanced minimum evolution (BME) polytope of order n is a polytope in binom(n, 2)-dimensional space whose vertices are indexed by bifurcating phylogenetic trees on n species. The coordinates of the ambient space are indexed by pairs (i, j) of distinct species, and at a vertex corresponding to tree T, the value at coordinate (i, j) is equal to 2^-k(i, j) where k(i, j) is the number of internal nodes on the path from i to j in T."
