        "It is quite easy to give a constructive proof that this sequence is infinite. For example, 64*x^3 + 49*x^2 + 14*x + 1 = (7*x+1)^2 + (4*x)^3 and 64*x^3 + 49*x^2 + 14*x + 2 = (x+1)^2 + (4*x+1)^3. Moreover, if 97*x^2 + 2*x + 1 = y^2, then 64*x^3 + 49*x^2 + 14*x = y^2 + (4*x-1)^3. Obviously there are infinitely many solutions to 97*x^2 + 2*x + 1 = y^2, so there are infinitely many k such that k, k+1 and k+2 are all sums of a positive square and a positive cube."
