        "a(n) = number of left-labeled (3,n)-bipartite graphs. The bipartite graphs counted here arise as representations of certain types of calls in switching networks in which three callers can be in a call with an arbitrary number (n) of receivers, and where callers are distinguishable, but the receivers are not. In a more abstract setting, a left-labeled (3,n)-bipartite graph is a graph with two sets of non-overlapping vertices I and O, where |I| = 3, |O| = n, and the vertices in I are considered different (distinguishable) up to subsets, whereas the n vertices in O are considered entirely interchangeable (indistinguishable). The sequence gives the number of non-isomorphic graphs under these assumptions."
