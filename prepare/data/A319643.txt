        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one block consisting of the indices (or positions) of the blocks containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.",

A weak antichain is a multiset of multisets, none of which is a proper submultiset of any other. For example, non-isomorphic representatives of the a(0) = 1 through a(4) = 15 T_0 weak antichains are:",
