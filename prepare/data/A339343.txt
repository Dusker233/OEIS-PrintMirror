        "The perfect numbers (A000396) which are a subset of the pseudoperfect numbers (A005835) are excluded from this sequence since otherwise they would all be trivial terms: if k is a perfect number then the sum of the divisors {d|k : 1 < d < k} is k-1, so any subset of them has a sum smaller than k.",
        "The pseudoperfect numbers are thus a disjoint union of the perfect numbers, this sequence, and A136446.",
        "The abundant numbers (A005101) are a disjoint union of the weird numbers (A006037), this sequence, and A136446.",
        "All the terms are primitive pseudoperfect (A006036), since if k*m is a pseudoperfect number with k > 1, and m also pseudoperfect, then it is a sum of a subset of its divisors, all of which are multiples of k and therefore larger than 1.",
        "This sequence is infinite. If p is an odd prime that is not a Mersenne prime (A000668), and k is the least number such that 2^k * p is an abundant number (A005101; i.e., the least k such that 2^(k+1) - 1 > p), then 2^k * p is a term (these are the nonperfect terms of A308710). If 2^k * p was not a term, then since it has only 2 odd divisors (1 and p), it would be equal to a sum of its even divisors (if 1 is not in the sum then p also cannot be in it). This would make 2^(k-1) * p also a pseudoperfect number, but by definition of k, 2^(k-1) * p is a deficient number (A005100).",
