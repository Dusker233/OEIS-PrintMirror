    "comment": [
        "For a Platonic solid create all possible planes defined by connecting any three of its vertices. For example, in the case of a cube this results in fourteen planes; six planes between the pairs of parallel edges connected to each end of the face diagonals, and eight planes from connecting the three vertices adjacent to each corner vertex. Use all the resulting planes to cut the solid into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the numbers of resulting polyhedra for the Platonic solids, ordered by number of vertices: tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, dodecahedron.",
        "See A338622 for the number and images of the k-faced polyhedra in each dissection for each of the five solids.",
