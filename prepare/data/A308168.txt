        "If k >= m-1, then every number can be represented as a multifactorial: m = m!k.",
        "The sequence contains only primes and numbers of the form p*q, where p and q are both prime and satisfy the inequalities p >= q and p-q < q-1.",
        "Proof: If m has exactly two prime factors p and q (p > q), but p and q do not satisfy the second inequality, then m = p!(p-q). If, on the other hand, m has at least three factors a, b and c, (a >= b >= c > 1, m = a*b*c), then a*b-c > c-1, so m = (a*b)!(a*b-c).",
        "Moreover, the sequence contains all numbers of that form. Proof: If they could be represented as a multifactorial, then it would be a (p-q)-tuple factorial. But as the second inequality is true, q-(p-q) is positive, therefore q-(p-q) should also divide m. But m has only two prime factors p and q, so the assumption is wrong and sequence indeed contains all numbers of that form.",
        "1 and 2 are not in the sequence, because (-1)- and 0-tuple factorials are not defined.",
