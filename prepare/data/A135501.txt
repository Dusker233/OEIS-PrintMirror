        "A lambda-term is a term which is either a variable \"x\" (of size 1), an application of two lambda-terms (of size 1 + the sum of the sizes of the two subterms), or a lambda binding a new variable in a term (of size 1 + the size of the subterm).",
        "The size of a lambda-term t can be equivalently defined as the number of ways of selecting a subterm of t (distinguishing between different occurrences of the same subterm). For example, the 2 closed terms with three subterms are \\x.\\y.x (subterms \\x.\\y.x, \\y.x, and x) and \\x.\\y.y (subterms \\x.\\y.y, \\y.y, and y), while the 4 with four subterms are \\x.\\y.\\z.x, \\x.\\y.\\z.y, \\x.\\y.\\z.z, and \\x.x(x) (subterms \\x.x(x), x(x), x[1], and x[2], distinguishing between the two occurrences of the variable x). - _Noam Zeilberger_, Nov 10 2018"
