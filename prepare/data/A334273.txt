    "comment": [
        "A necklace is a finite sequence of positive integers that is lexicographically less than or equal to any cyclic rotation. Co-necklaces are defined similarly, except with greater instead of less.",
        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions."
