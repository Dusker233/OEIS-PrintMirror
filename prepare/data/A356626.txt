        "Let n_2 be the binary expansion of n with a length of b bits. Let W(n) = A000120(n) the binary weight of n, i.e., the number of ones in n_2, while Z(n) = b - W(n) be the number of zeros in n_2. Let Q be the number of runs of ones in n_2, L(k) be the run length of the k-th least significant run of ones, and P(k) the partial sum of the number of zeros to the right of the k-th run of ones.",

        "Theorem 1: the maximum of s(n) for n = 2^(k-1)+1..2^k is a prime power.",
        "Proof. s(n) corresponds to f(m), m = n-1, hence m = 2^(k-1)..2^k. The number m in this domain has k bits. Binary numbers involve zeros and ones, thus, k = W(m) + Z(m). It is clear that W(m) = Omega(f(m)) and Z(m) = pi(gpf(f(m)))-1. Hence we have k = Omega(f(m)) + pi(gpf(f(m)))-1. We maximize f(m) for a k-bit number m when the greatest prime factor of f(m) has maximum multiplicity, therefore the maximum of s(n) for n = 2^(k-1)+1..2^k is a prime power.",
