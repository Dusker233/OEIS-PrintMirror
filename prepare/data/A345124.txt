        "Proof that a(n) exists for all n: The numbers that are equal to f(k) for some m-fold composition f of the functions 6*x +- 1 can be written as 6^m*k +- c, where c is in the set C_m, defined by C_1 = {1} and C_{m+1} = {6*c +- 1 for c in C_m}. Choose a positive integer k_0 that is divisible by all numbers in C_m for 1 <= m <= n. Then 6^m*k_0 +- c is divisible by (and greater than) c, so it is composite if c > 1. (In fact, the largest number in C_m is A003464(m).) Since there are arbitrarily long prime gaps, we can choose a positive integer r such that 6*k_0*r +- 1 are both composite. With k = k_0*r, the numbers 6^m*k +- c will all be composite for c in C_m, 1 <= m <= n, as desired. - _Pontus von Br\u00f6mssen_, Nov 01 2021"
