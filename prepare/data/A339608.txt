        "A Lyndon word is a word which is lexicographically smaller than all its nontrivial rotations.",

Since each natural number has a unique string representation in bijective bases, it can also be written exactly one way as a concatenation of these numbers in nonincreasing lexicographic order, in bijective base-2."
