        "The difference between the matching ratios is evaluated by dividing the larger by the smaller.",
        "Take a rectangle A with sides n and n+m; remove a square of side n from one end to form rectangle B with sides n and m; scale B in the ratio (n+m):n to form rectangle C with a side n+m. Place A and C alongside, with edges of length n+m coinciding, to form rectangle D. For n > 0, let m_n be the m that has the coincident edges dividing D in nearest to equal proportions, then a(n) = n + m_n.",
        "Compared with other neighboring values of n, the resulting proportions can be made most nearly equal when n is a Fibonacci number F(k) = A000045(k), k > 1, in which case a(n) is F(k+1). In contrast, if 2n is a Fibonacci number F(k), then a relatively good choice for rectangle A's longer side would be F(k+1)/2, except that F(k+1) is odd when F(k) is even, so F(k+1)/2 is halfway between integers.",
        "a(n) is usually the same as A007067(n), but when 2n is a Fibonacci number, they sometimes differ. The first differences are a(4) = 7 = A007067(4) + 1 and a(72) = 117 = A007067(72) + 1. The author expects a(n) to differ from A007067(n) if and only if n is in A060645. The terms of A060645 are half the value of alternate even Fibonacci numbers.",
        "More specifically, for k > 0: F(3k) is an even Fibonacci number, F(3k+1) is odd and a(F(3k)/2) = F(3k+1)/2 + 1/2; whereas A007067(F(6k+3)/2) = F(6k+4)/2 + 1/2, but A007067(F(6k)/2) = F(6k+1)/2 - 1/2."
