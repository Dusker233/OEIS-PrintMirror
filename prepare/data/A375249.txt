        "Inspired by A160324 and analogous to A020757.",
        "C. F. Gauss proved that all positive integers can be expressed as the sum of three triangular numbers. However, Zhi-Wei Sun (2009) has shown that there are 95 candidates for universal triples. This sequence looks at the {p4, p5, p6} triples and ask which integers require all three members to satisfy the sum.",
