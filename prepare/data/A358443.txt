    "comment": [
        "This sequence is generated by a sieve. Its first term is odd, and the rest are even numbers. Since every remaining number is crossed out after a(11) is determined, the sequence is finite, having only 11 terms.",
        "Consider hyperplanes with eleven dimensions and a normal vector N = {2, 3, ..., 12} and with distances to the origin |(k+162)|/|N| and k is an integer. We will find at least one point with only integer coordinates for each of these distances located on such a hyperplane. If k is positive then a hyperplane exists where such a point has only positive coordinates. - _Thomas Scheuerle_, Nov 17 2022"
