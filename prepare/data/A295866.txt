        "In his book on analytic number theory, Don Newman tells this amusing story regarding the number of digits in p(n): \"This is told of Major MacMahon who kept a list of these partition numbers arranged one under another up into the hundreds. It suddenly occurred to him that, viewed from a distance, the outline of the digits seemed to form a parabola! Thus the number of digits in p(n), the number of partitions of n, is around C*sqrt(n), or p(n) itself is very roughly e^(a*sqrt(n)). The first crude assessment of p(n)!\""
