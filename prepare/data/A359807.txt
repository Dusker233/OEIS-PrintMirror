        "The next distinct term here occurs at index a(i)+i+1 for every index i. This is equivalent to the wait until the newest distinct term appears in A272727, where we are waiting for the middle term to coincide with itself in the sequence's reverse. Likewise, in A037988, n terms must accumulate before the next term greater than 2*n, giving the same terms as in this sequence."
