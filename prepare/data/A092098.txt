        "Number of chambers in an n-sected triangle. That is, n sectors are extended from each vertex to the opposite edge of the triangle. - _Eric Gottlieb_, Jun 26 2005",
        "How many chambers does the edge n-sected simplex with m vertices have? We have given just the first few terms of the case m = 3. This question is natural in the context of central hyperplane arrangements as it generalizes the braid arrangement. Mike Ackerman, Sul-Young Choi, Peter Coughlin, Japheth Wood and I originally encountered the question in the context of voting theory, where we were exploring ways to tabulate votes when voters' preferences are partially ordered. Unfortunately, it turns out that the chambers of the 3-sected simplex with n vertices are not in correspondence with the set of posets on n letters as the chain with three elements and a fourth incomparable element illustrates. - _Eric Gottlieb_, Jun 26 2005",
        "\"Equilateral\" is not needed: the sequence counts regions correctly for any triangle with n-sected sides. Ceva's Theorem is used to deduct vanishing regions from the naive count. The first deduction is at n=15 for n odd and n=20 for n even. - _Len Smiley_ and Brian Wick (mathclub(AT)math.uaa.alaska.edu), Jul 04 2005"
