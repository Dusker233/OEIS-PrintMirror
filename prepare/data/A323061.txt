        "The product of the first and last digits of a term is a multiple of 10, i.e., the first and last digits of a term are the digit 5 and an even nonzero digit.",
        "The sequence has an infinite number of terms. For instance, 601x065 is a term where x is a string of k repeated digits 6 and k >= 0, i.e., 601065, 6016065, 60166065, etc. Similarly numbers of the form 560x106 are also terms.",
        "To see this, let a = 601*10^(3+k) + 65 + 6000*(10^k-1)/9. Then R(a) = 56*10^(4+k) + 106 + 6000*(10^k-1)/9. The number 10*a*R(a) can be written as 30360100*(10^(k + 3) - 1)^2/9 whose square root is 5510*(10^(k + 3) - 1)/3.",

The number 10*a*R(a) can be written as 14084942400*(10^(k+5) - 1)^2, whose square root is 118680*(10^(k+5) - 1).",

The number n = w*10^(k+m)+w = w*(10^(k+m)+1) where m is the number of digits of w. Note that n is also not a multiple of 10. Then R(n) = R(w)*10^(k+m)+R(w) = R(w)(10^(k+m)+1). Then 10*n*R(n) = 10*w*R(w)(10^(k+m)+1)^2 which is a square since w is a term.",
