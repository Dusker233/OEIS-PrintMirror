    "comment": [
        "The embedding must map edges in the graph onto either horizontal or vertical grid lines of length 1 or diagonals of length sqrt(2). Vertices in the graph must map onto lattice points, and of course must preserve the incidence structure of the graph. A square in the lattice may have both diagonals present - their intersection does not count as an incidence.",
        "Configurations differing only a rotation or reflection are not counted as different.",
        "The resulting figures are variously called 'polysticks', 'polyedges' or 'polyforms'."
