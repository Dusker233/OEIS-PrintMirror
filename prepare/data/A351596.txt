        "The n-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of n, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions."
