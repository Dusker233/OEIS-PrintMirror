        "For n=2, assume the two disks are on North initially, first move the smallest one to South in 2 moves, then the largest one to East in 1 move, the smallest one back to North in 2 moves, the largest one to West in 2 moves, and finally the smallest one to West in 3 moves, with a total of 10 moves. Each disk has a number of moves which is 3 mod 4, thus a(n) == 3*n (mod 4)."
