        "The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [RED ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL] or [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; BLUE],  given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the sequence is optimal (the sequence presented gives the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle for the given pre-coloring configurations). Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",
        "Disk numbering is from largest disk (k = 1) to smallest disk (k = N)",

        "Number of moves of disk k, for large k,  is close to (7/11)*3^(k-1) ~ 0.636*3^(k-1). Series designation: P636(k)."
