        "We start with the three corner points of the triangle, and add n further points along each edge. Including the corner points, we end up with n+2 points along each edge, and the edge is divided into n+1 line segments.",
        "Each of the n points added to an edge is joined by 2*n chords to the points that were added to the other two edges. There are 3*n^2 chords."
