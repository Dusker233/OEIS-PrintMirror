        "See sequence A322269 for further explanations. This sequence is related to A322269(2).",
        "The sequence is periodic, repeating itself after phi(24) terms. Its largest term is 23, which is A322269(2). In order to satisfy the conditions, both f and b must be coprime to 24.",

        "In this case, the sequence is trivial, since each term is being multiplied by itself. The next related sequence, A322272, corresponding to A322269(3), already has several nontrivial terms."
