        "5 is in the sequence because if you start the algorithm from every prime < 5, you obtain a number of primes less than starting from 5. In fact, starting from 5, which is the 3rd prime number, you have (5-pi(5))=2, which is prime, then (2-pi(2))=1, which is not prime and so the algorithm stops. So applying the algorithm from 5 you have two prime numbers, 5 and 2. If you start the algorithm from any other prime < 5, then you have only one prime."
