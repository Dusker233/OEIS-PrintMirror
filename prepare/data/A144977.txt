        "a(n) is the number of hyperforests with n unlabeled nodes without trees of order 2. This follows from the fact that for n >= 2 A134955(n-2) counts the hyperforests of order n with one or more trees of order 2.",
        "The unique hyperforest (without loops) of order 1 is an isolated vertex, so a(1) = 1.",
