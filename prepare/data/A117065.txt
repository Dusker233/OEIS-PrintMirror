        "5 is the only prime pentagonal number; every greater pentagonal number A000326(n) = n(3n-1)/2 is either divisible by n/2 or (3n-1)/2. Every number is the sum of 5 pentagonal numbers, hence every prime is the sum of 5 pentagonal numbers. There are an infinite number of primes which are the sum of two pentagonal numbers, the subset of primes which are the sum of two pentagonal numbers in exactly two different ways begins {211, 853, 1259, 1427, 1571, 2297, 2351}.",
        "The sum may include the pentagonal number 0. Hence this sequence does not have any primes that are the sum of two positive pentagonal numbers. The sequence is probably finite. There are no other primes < 59900. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 19 2006",
