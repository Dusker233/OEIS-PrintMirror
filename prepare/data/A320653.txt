        "The associated coefficient of a hypergraph is the weight assigned to it in the generalized Harary-Sachs formula (arxiv link to be posted).  For example, the 2-uniform simplex is a triangle and a(2) = 2.  Famously the codegree 3 coefficient of the adjacency characteristic polynomial of a graph is -a(2)(# of triangles in G).  The quantity a(n)=C_n as mentioned in Cooper and Dutle wherein the authors computed the values up to n=5."
