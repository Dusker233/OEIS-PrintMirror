        "This sequence gives all solutions of one of two classes of positive proper solutions a(n) = a5(n) of the Pell equation a(n)^2 - 5*b(n) = -4 with b(n) = b5(n) = F(6*n+5) = A134497(n), with the Fibonacci numbers F = A000045. These solutions are obtained from the fundamental positive solution [11, 5] (to be read as a column vector) by application of positive powers of the automorphic matrix A = matrix([9, 20], [4, 9]) of determinant +1.",
        "The other class of positive proper solutions is obtained similarly from the fundamental solution [1,1] and is given by [a1(n), b1(n)], with a1(n) = A305315(n) and b1(n) = A134493(n) = F(6*n+1).",
        "The remaining positive solutions are improper and are obtained by application of positive powers of the same matrix A on the fundamental improper solution [4, 2]. They are given by [a3(n), b3(n)], with a3(n) = F(6*n+3) = 4* A049629(n) and b3(n) = A134495(n) = 2*A007805(n).",
