    "comment": [
        "The equivalence operations described in the title are commonly used when discussing Hadamard matrices, for example (see A096201). They are natural when considering norms of these matrices or properties that can be inferred from their singular values, since they do not change singular values. See A352099 for the version of this sequence that does not consider transposition as part of the equivalence relation.",
        "Since the row and column multiplication operations can be used to force the first row and column to consist only of ones, 2^[(n-1)^2] is an upper bound on this sequence. A lower bound is 2^[n*(n-2)] / (n!)^2."
