        "We use toothpicks of length 2, the same as the toothpick cellular automaton of A139250, but here we are on triangular grid, hence we have three axes, not two.",
        "The Toothpicks are alternately arranged on the three axes in a rotating cycle.",
        "a(n) gives the number of toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage.",
        "A296511 (the first differences) gives the number of toothpicks added at n-th stage.",
        "The structure reveals that some cellular automata that have recurrent periods can be represented by irregular triangles of first differences whose row lengths are the terms of A011782 multiplied by k (instead of powers of 2), where k is the length of their \"word\". In this case the word should be \"abc\", therefore k = 3. In the case of the cellular automaton with normal toothpicks (A139250) the word should be \"ab\", therefore k = 2.",
        "For more information about the \"word\" of a cellular automaton see A296612.",
        "Note that due to the unusual orientation of the polygons that are located on the edges of the structure, the image of this cellular automaton resembles the photo of an object that is rotating.",
        "Note that between other polygons the structure contains the same \"petals\" as the floret pentagonal tiling.",
        "Apparently the graph could be similar to the graph of A151907."
