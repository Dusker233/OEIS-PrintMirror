        "The initial 5 is the only prime in this sequence (for a proof, consider _Henry Bottomley_'s Sep 27 2006 formula for A024451), the next three terms 9, 15, 25 are only semiprimes (see A087112 and A370129), and there are 21 terms with three prime factors in total: 30, 42, 45, 63, 75, 105, 110, 125, 147, 165, 175, 231, 245, 275, 343, 363, 385, 539, 605, 847, 1331 (see A369979, A370138 and A373844).
