    "comment": [
        "The first subsequence composed of one prime is {2}, whose unique element has zero distance with itself, and the same happens with the first subsequence of one element {3} that differs from {2}. As these distances are equal to zero they coincide, so a(1) = 2 because subsequence {3} is at position 2 in the sequence of primes."

    "example": [
        "The first subsequence composed of two primes is {2,3}; the distance between its elements is 1. The subsequence of two primes {3,5} is the first subsequence that differs from {2,3}, and the distance between its elements is 2, a distance that coincides with 1 with a scale factor of 1/2, so a(2) = 2 because the first prime in the subsequence {3,5} is the 2nd prime.",
        "The first subsequence composed of three primes is {2,3,5}; the distances between its consecutive elements are (1,2). The first subsequence of three primes {5,7,11} differs from {2,3,5} and the distances between its consecutive elements are (2,4), and these distances coincide with (1,2) with a scale factor of 1/2, so a(3) = 3 because the first prime in the subsequence {5,7,11} is the 3rd prime."
