    "comment": [
        "In this sequence, no similar digit sharing constraint applies between equivalent m^k's, so 2^4 = 4^2 = 16 is a valid term here.",
        "Can a term exist in this sequence where neither m, k, m^k contains the decimal digit 2 in any of the ways m^k may be written? Examples for all the other missing decimal digits from m, k and m^k are easily found among the terms."
    ],
    "example": [
        "10648 (where m=22, k=3) is a term because 22^3 = 10648 and the three sets of digits [2], [3] and [1,0,6,4,8] are mutually disjoint.",
        "81 is a term because 3^4 = 81 and the three sets of digits [3], [4] and [8,1] are mutually disjoint. 9^2 = 81 too, and here the three sets of digits [9], [2] and [8,1] are also mutually disjoint. This example illustrates the cases where there is more than one choice for m and k."
