        "Squarefree numbers (A005117) in A071395. The number of terms with n prime factors are counted in A295369. The subsequence of odd terms is A249263.",
        "Two variants of the present sequence are possible: the terms listed by size, or as a table whose n-th row gives all those with n prime factors (so that A295369 would be the row lengths). They would differ only from a(322) = 692835 on, which is the first term with 6 prime factors, while a(755) = 4199030 is the last term with 5 prime factors.",
        "A subsequence of the variant A249242, squarefree primitive abundant numbers using the 2nd definition, A091191, i.e., having no abundant proper divisors.",
        "These numbers are also primitive unitary abundant numbers: unitary abundant numbers (A034683) that are also primitive abundant numbers (A071395). A unitary abundant number k is primitive if and only if usigma(k) - 2*k < 2*k/p^e, where p^e is the largest prime power dividing k and usigma is the sum of unitary divisors function (A034448). For numbers k in this sequence limsup_{k->oo} usigma(k)/k = 2. (Prasad and Reddy, 1990). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jul 18 2020"
