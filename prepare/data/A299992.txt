        "Composite numbers m have nondivisors k in the cototient such that k | n^e with e > 1. These k appear in row n of A272618 and are enumerated by A243822(n). These nondivisors k are a kind of \"regular\" number along with divisors d of n; both are listed in row n of A162306 and are together enumerated by A045763(n).",
        "Primes p have 2 divisors {1, p}; these two numbers constitute the cototient of p: there are no nondivisors in the cototient.",
        "Prime powers p^i have (i + 1) divisors; all smaller powers of the same prime p, i.e., p^j with 0 <= j <= i, also divide p^i. These numbers constitute the cototient of p^i; there are no nondivisors in the cototient.",
        "Therefore, we can ignore cases where n has no nondivisors in the cototient, since they obviously have more divisors than nondivisors therein.",
