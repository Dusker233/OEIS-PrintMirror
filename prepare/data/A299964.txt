        "A cyclotomic binary form over Z is a homogeneous polynomial in two variables which has the form f(x, y) = y^EulerPhi(k)*CyclotomicPolynomial(k, x/y) where k is some integer >= 3. An integer n is in this sequence if f(x,y) = n has more than one integer solution where f is a cyclotomic binary form and x and y are prime numbers with 0 < y < x."
