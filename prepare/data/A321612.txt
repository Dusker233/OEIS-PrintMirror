        "The following is a quotation from Hage-Hassan in his paper (see Link below). \"The (concept of) right and left symmetry is fundamental in physics. This incites us to ask whether this symmetry is in (the) primes. Find the numbers n with a + a' = n. a, a' are primes and {a} are all the primes with: n/2 <= a < n and n = 2,3, ...\"",
        "This sequence is analogous to A320447. Instead of the sequence of primes it uses the sequence of triangular numbers (A000217). It is conjectured that the sequence is finite and full."
