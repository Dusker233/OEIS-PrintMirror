        "Conjecture: a(n)/n -> 5.89..., as n -> infinity, and if m denotes this number, then -1 < m - a(n)/n <= m - 4 < 2 for n >= 1.",
        "From _Michel Dekking_, Mar 18 2018: (Start)",
        "Here is a proof of part of this conjecture. We recall from the comments of A287372 that A287372 = delta(x), where x is the fixed point of sigma^2 with x(1)=3. Here sigma is the morphism on {1,2,3} given by",
        "    sigma(1) = 2,   sigma(2) = 3,   sigma(3) = 2112,",
        "and delta is the 'decoration' morphism defined by",
        "    delta(1) = 00,  delta(2) = 1000,  delta(3) = 0001000.",

        "    |0 1 0|.",
        "The characteristic polynomial of M is equal to chi(u) = u^3-2u-2. It is well known that the frequencies mu[1], mu[2] and mu[3] in x exist, and can be computed from the Perron Frobenius eigenvalue LPF of M.",
        "Solving chi(u) = 0, one finds that",
        "     LPF = (1/3)*(27+3*sqrt(57))^(1/3)+2/(27+3*sqrt(57))^(1/3).",
        "For the frequencies one computes",
        "    mu[1] = 2/D,  mu[2] = LPF^2/D,  and mu[3] = LPF/D,",

        "letters 1 in SR^n(00) = delta(sigma^n(1)), where N(i)(w) denotes the number of occurrences of the letter i in a word w.",
        "The position of the A(n)-th 1 in SR^n(00) is equal to the length of SR^n(00), with an error of at most 7 positions. It follows that",
