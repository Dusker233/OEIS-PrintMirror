        "The converse to Lagrange's theorem does not hold. A340511 lists the numbers n such that there exists a group of order n which has no subgroup of order d, for some divisor d of n; they are called \"non-converse Lagrange theorem\" (NCLT) orders.",
        "A finite group is supersolvable (SS) if it has a normal series of subgroups with cyclic factors; A066085 lists the numbers for which there exists a group of order n that is not supersolvable; they are called a \"non-supersolvable\" (NSS) order.",
        "Theorem: Every NCLT order is an NSS order (see MacHale-Manning, 2016, Theorem 3, page 2); hence A340511 is a subsequence of A066085.",
        "However, there exist infinitely many NSS orders that are not NCLT orders (see MacHale-Manning, 2016, Corollary 19, page 6) and these NSS-CLT orders are listed in this sequence.",
        "Theorem: The number 224*p is an NSS-CLT order for all primes p <> 2, 3, 5, 7, 31 (see MacHale-Manning, 2016, Theorem 18, page 6). So, 10528, 11872, 13216, 13664, 15008, 15904, ... are other terms."
