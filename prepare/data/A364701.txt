        "The sequence b(n) defined by the generating function (3*x^4+5*x^2+6*x-7)/(4*x^7+x^4+x^2+x-1) has the property that b(p) == 1 (mod p) if p is a prime. A pseudoprime for b(n) is a composite number k such that b(k) == 1 (mod k).",
        "The first five pseudoprimes are the only ones up to 10^10."
