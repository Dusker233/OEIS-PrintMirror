        "Coding the symbols according to 2<->2, 4<->0, 3<->1, this leads to the morphism 2->0, 1->12, 0->10 on the alphabet {0,1,2}.",
        "This is simply sigma, which has A287104 as its unique fixed point. So the sequence d of first differences of (a(n)) equals A287104 with the coding above. Noting that the code can be written as x->4-x, this gives the formula below.",
