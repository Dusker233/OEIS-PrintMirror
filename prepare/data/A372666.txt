        "In other words, \"almost primorial numbers\": those obtained from primorials (A002110) through division by one single prime which is greater than the least prime divisor and less that the greatest prime divisor of each primorial (results sorted by size). Same as A077011 constrained by exclusion of A002110(k)/prime(1) and A002110(k)/prime(k), so there are no primorial or half primorial terms. Each primorial A002110(k), k > 2, contributes k-2 terms to the sequence.",
