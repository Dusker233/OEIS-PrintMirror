        "After the Dyck paths described in A237593 we can see that a(n) has a symmetric representation as follows: a(n) is the sum of the areas of two polygons. In the fourth quadrant of the infinite square grid the first polygon has a vertex at (0,0) and its area is equal to A000217(n). The second polygon appears if n >= 3 and it has a vertex at (n,-n) and its area is equal to A004125(n). So the area of the arrowhead-shaped polygon is equal to A153485(n). See the illustration of initial terms in the Links section."
