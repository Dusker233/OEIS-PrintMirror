        "This is a variation of A347990. The same walk rules apply except that the walk is confined to one quadrant of the 2D square lattice. See A347990 for further details."

    "example": [
        "a(0..3) are the same as the standard SAW on one quadrant of a square lattice, see A038373, as the walk cannot step to a smaller ring in the first three steps.",
        "a(4) = 22. If we restrict the first one or more steps to the right followed by an upward step then there is one walk which steps to a smaller ring and is thus forbidden. That is the walk (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1). As this can be walked in two different ways in one quadrant the number of 4-step walks becomes A038373(4) - 2 = 24 - 2 = 22."
