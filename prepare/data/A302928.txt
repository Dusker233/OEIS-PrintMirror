        "There is no maximum. We can take k copies of the 17-mine configuration and place them sufficiently far apart to get 18k fours. So a(17k) - 17k >= 18k - 17k = k can get arbitrarily large. A possibly more interesting question is to ask about the maximum ratio a(n)/n. - _Yevhenii Diomidov_, Jan 19 2022"
