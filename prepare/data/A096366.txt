        "A friendly integer can be both primitive and nonprimitive. For example, consider 30. First, 30 is friendly to 140, but this relation is nonprimitive, because it is 5 times the friendly pair {6, 28}. But then, 30 is also friendly to 6200, and this is a primitive pair (not a scaling of a smaller friendly pair). - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Dec 07 2022"
