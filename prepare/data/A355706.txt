        "Because asymptotically the size of the partition number function p(n) is ~ O(exp(sqrt(n))), and the probability of primality of p(n) is ~ O(1/sqrt(n)) and the combined probability of primality of p(n) and p(n)+-2 is ~ O(1/n), the sum of the prime probabilities is diverging and there are no obvious restrictions on primality; therefore, this sequence may be conjectured to be infinite.",
        "p(2335166), a 1696-digit number, was known to be prime and proven prime by F. Morain using his software (ca. April 2001), but the primality of p(2335166)+2 was found by targeted search (for this sequence) in July 2022.",
