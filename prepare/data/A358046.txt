    "comment": [
        "Consider a self-avoiding walk on a 2D square lattice where two visited lattice points are considered to be visible from each other if either no other lattice points exist on the line drawn directly between these two lattice points, or if such points exist, they have not been visited by previous steps of the walk. This sequence lists the number of n-step self-avoiding walks for which the first visited lattice point of the walk is directly visible from the last visited point. See the examples below.",
        "For the walks studied there is a difference in the ratio for the number of end-to-end visible walks to all walks for steps with even-n to odd-n. For example a(28)/A001411(28) ~ 0.72, while a(29)/A001411(29) ~ 0.88. The values and behavior of these ratios as n -> infinity is unknown.",
        "See A358036 for the number of walks where the path between lattice points is also considered when determining point visibility."
