        "The nine sequences A308199, A319967, A319968, A322410, A322409,  A322411,  A322413, A322412, A322414 are based on defining the tribonacci ternary word to start with index 0 (in contrast to the usual definition, in A080843 and A092782, which starts with index 1). As a result these nine sequences differ from the compound tribonacci sequences defined in  A278040, A278041, and A319966-A319972. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 05 2019"

        "This formula already follows from Theorem 15 in the 1972 paper by Carlitz et al., which gives that b(c(n)) = a(n) + 2b(n) + 2c(n), where a, b and c are the classical positional sequences of the letters in the tribonacci word. The connection is made by using that c(n) = a(n) + b(n) + n, and by making the translation B(n) = a(n+1)-1, A(n) = b(n+1)-1, C(n) = c(n+1)-1.
