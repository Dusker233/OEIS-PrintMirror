        "We study Maharaja Nim on the square spiral, as in A307282, A307283, and in particular the P-positions in the 4th quadrant. As in A140100 and A140101 (which are the analogs if we use a Queen instead of a Maharaja) we take the X-axis to point South and the Y-axis to point East.",
        "The P-positions now lie on two roughly straight lines, with coordinates (X_upper(n), Y_upper(n)) with X_upper(n) <= Y_upper(n), and (X_lower(n), Y_lower(n)) with X_lower(n) <= Y_lower(n). These four sequences are A307284-A307287.",
        "The two lines are the hard-to-see black pixels in the fourth quadrant in the Sigrist illustration."
