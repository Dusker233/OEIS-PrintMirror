        "The squares of numbers in each row can be gathered in an equation with the first n terms on one side, the next n+1 terms on the other. The third row, for example, could be rendered as 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 + 14^2.",
        "This sequence contains all nonnegative integers that are within a distance of n from 2n^2 + 2n where n is any nonnegative integer. The nonnegative integers that are not in this sequence are of the form 2n^2 + k where n is any positive integer and -n <= k <= n-1. Also, when n is the product of two consecutive integers, a(n) = 2n; for example, a(20) = 40. See explicit formulas for the sequence in the formula section below. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Aug 09 2013",
