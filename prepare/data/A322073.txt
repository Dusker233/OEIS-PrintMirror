        "The weight distribution list [w_0,w_1,...,w_30] = [1,0,0,6,0,53,0,339,0,1782,5284,0,8919,...,1] where w_i is the number of codewords of weight i, represents the most common weight distribution for the binary self-dual codes of length 2*15 = 30.  There are a(15) = 16 binary self-dual codes that have this weight enumerator.  Ellipses are used to shorten the list since the list is symmetrical (i.e., w_n = w_{30-n}).",
        "The indexing of the list is 2n since there are no binary self-dual codes of odd length."
