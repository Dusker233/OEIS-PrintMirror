        "The number of conjugacy classes of pairs of commuting elements in a finite group G is the cardinality of the set {c(a,b) | a,b in G and ab=ba} where c(a,b) = {(gag^(-1),gbg^(-1)) | g in G}.",
        "It is equal to the number of conjugacy classes within the centralizers of class representatives of G.",
        "This reformulation was employed in the sequence-generating program.",
        "It is also equal to the rank of the modular fusion category Z(Rep(G)), the Drinfeld center of Rep(G).",
        "These reformulations are explained in the linked MathOverflow posts."
