        "(1) If 2^p-1 is prime (a Mersenne prime) then 2^(p-2)*(2^p-1) is in the sequence - the proof is easy. So 2^(A000043-2)*(2^A000043-1) is a subsequence of this sequence.",
        "(2) If k is in the sequence and 3 doesn't divide k then 3*k is in the sequence. Hence if 2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime greater than 3 then 3*2^(p-2)*(2^p-1) is in the sequence.",
        "Statement (2) is a special case of \"If gcd(m,k)=1 and m & k are in the sequence then m*k is in the sequence (*)\". (*) is correct because the three functions ud, phi & sigma are multiplicative.",
