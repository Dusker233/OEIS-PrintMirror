        "Apparently, by saying \"valley\" of a permutation of [n], _Aaron Meyerowitz_ indirectly assumes that a \"valley\" is an interior minimum of a permutation (i.e., we ignore possible minima at the endpoints). Since the complement of a permutation b_1 b_2 ... b_n (using one-line notation, not cycle notation) is (n+1-b_1) (n+1-b_2) ... (n+1-b_n), the current sequence is also the number of permutations of [n] with exactly one peak (that is, exactly one interior maximum).",
        "Comtet (pp. 260-261 in his book) calls these peaks \"intermediary peaks\" to distinguish them from \"left peaks\" and \"right peaks\" (i.e., maxima at the endpoints).",
