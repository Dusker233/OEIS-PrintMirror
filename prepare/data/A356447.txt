        "It is well known that B(k) divided by (k+1) is an integer (the Catalan numbers A000108). It is also easy to see that (2k-1) divides B(k). So we ask when the product (k+1)*(2k-1) divides B(k). The terms of this sequence are the positive integers k such that (k+1)*(2k-1) does not divide B(k).",
        "A necessary and sufficient condition for an integer k to be a term of this sequence is: k is congruent to 2 (mod 3), and at least one of (k+1) or (k-1) has no 2's in its base-3 expansion. In particular, this sequence has density 0. This is proved in the Stack Exchange post cited below.",
        "Other equivalent conditions are:",
        "1) k is congruent to 2 (mod 3), and its base-3 expansion either has no 2's, or is of form u12, or u02^i for some i>=1, where u has no 2's and 2^i means a string of i consecutive 2's.",
