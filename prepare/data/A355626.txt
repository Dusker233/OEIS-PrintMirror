        "Bounds on the values t_i can be derived as shown in \"Bounds on t_i when the product of factors (3 + 1/t_i) is given\" in the Links section. These bounds allow to calculate a(3) = 80 and a(4) = 15222 with the PARI program in the link. It seems that determining a(5) would need stronger methods. The identity (3 + 1/82) * (3 + 1/6670) * (3 + 1/44484454) * (3 + 1/1978866618021814) * (3 + 1/3915913091921090597566167836053) = 244 shows that the values t_n can get quite large. Integer products of more factors (3 + 1/t_i) can have even much larger t_n."

Solving p = 10, p = 11, p = 12 with 2 <= t_1 <= 6 for t_2 shows that the only integer solutions are (t_1,t_2) = (4,13) and (t_1,t_2) = (5,8) for p = 10, and (t_1,t_2) = (2,7) for p = 11."
