        "For large N, Benito and Varona have shown that a(N)~2/pi^2 Log(1+sqrt(2)).N +O(sqrt(N)). However, the approximations to a(N)/N are considerably more accurate than the error term suggests, and it certainly appears that the density of the primitive triples with both legs less than N tends towards 2/pi^2 Log(1+sqrt(2))=0.1786... as N becomes large."
