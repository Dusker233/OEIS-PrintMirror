        "We define a sequence to be weakly alternating if it is alternately weakly increasing and weakly decreasing, starting with either.",
        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions."
