        "These numbers are exactly the numbers of the form 2^a * p^(4b+1) * m^2 where p is a prime number congruent to 1 modulo 4, a is a nonnegative integer, and m is a positive integer coprime to p. In particular, they are also sums of two squares: the sequence has the first 12 terms in common with A132777.",
        "I corrected the above comment by adding the exponent (4b+1) to p, because otherwise it would miss terms like a(614) = 3125 = 5^5, a(1140) = 6250 = 2 * 5^5, a(4421) = 28125 = 5^5 * 3^2, etc. - _Antti Karttunen_, May 25 2022"
