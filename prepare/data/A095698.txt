        "Another variant of A095236: Here each phone after the first selected (which can still be any) is chosen such that the total distance in the normal sense from the chosen phone to all previously-chosen phones in the row is maximized. (Equivalently, the average distance is maximized.) Another space- or privacy-conscious selection strategy. Are there any applications of this sequence to phyllotaxy? Gregarious (or eavesdropping) strategy: If, instead, the total (average) distance is minimized, the sequence generated is 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,..., apparently the nonnegative powers of 2.",
