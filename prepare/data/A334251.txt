        "Application: Not all electronic devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) have batteries or are connected to the power cable. These self-contained devices must rely on the harvesting of energy of the signals sent by a transmitter. We investigate binary systems emitting 0's and 1's signals where it is assumed that the 1's carry the energy. A minimal number of 1's in transmitted sequences is required so as to carry sufficient energy within a prescribed time span. A binary sequence is said to obey the sliding-window (ell,t)-constraint if the number of 1's within any window of ell consecutive bits of that sequence is at least t, t<ell."
