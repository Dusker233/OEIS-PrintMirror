        "The sqrt steps in the definition are equivalent to A211667 but here factors of 2 instead of counting, so a(n) = 2^A211667(n).  A211667 is a double logarithm and the effect of power 2^ is to turn the second into a rounding.  So a(n) is the bit length of n (see A070939) increased to the next power of 2 if not already a power of 2.  Each n = 2^(2^k) is a new high a(n) = 2^(k+1), since such an n is bit length 2^k+1.",
        "In a microcomputer, it's common for machine words to be power-of-2 sizes such as 16, 32, 64, 128 bits.  a(n) can be thought of as the word size needed to contain integer n.  Some algorithms by their nature expect power-of-2 sizes, for example Sch\u00f6nhage and Strassen's big integer multiplication.",
        "This sequence differs from A334789 (2^log*(n)) for n>=256.  For example a(256)=16 whereas A334789(256)=8.  The respective exponent sequences are A211667 (for here) and A001069 (for A334789) which likewise differ for n>=256.",
