    "comment": [
        "The n-th greedy frac multiple of x is the smallest integer that does not cause Sum_{k=1..n} frac(a(k)*x) to exceed unity; an infinite number of terms appear as the denominators of the convergents to the continued fraction of x."

        "a(4) = 45 since frac(1*x) + frac(2*x) + frac(14*x) + frac(45*x) < 1, while frac(1*x) + frac(2*x) + frac(14*x) + frac(k*x) > 1 for all k > 14 and k < 45."
