        "An idempotent factorization of n is a way of writing n = p*q such that b^(k(p-1)(q-1)+1) is congruent to b mod n for any integer k >= 0 and any b in Z_n. For example, p = 19, q = 15 is an idempotent factorization of n = 285.  All factorizations of semiprimes are idempotent, so this sequence is restricted to n with >= 3 factors.  Idempotent factorizations have the property that p and q generate correctly functioning RSA keys, even if one or both are composite.",
