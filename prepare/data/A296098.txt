        "Of the 482 triangular numbers < 55030954895280 that can be represented as a product of seven triangular numbers greater than 1, the only one that can be represented as a product of two triangular numbers greater than 1 is 218434391280, which cannot be represented as a product of 3 triangular numbers greater than 1. Thus, a(n) >= 55030954895280 for all n >= 7.",
        "However, 55030954895280 can be represented (see Example section) as a product of k triangular numbers greater than 1 for all k in 1,2,...,12 (but not for k=13), so a(7) = a(8) = ... = a(12) = 55030954895280 (and, for each n > 12, a(n) > 55030954895280, or a(n) = -1 if no such number exists).",
