        "A ternary word is one over a three-letter alphabet, such as {0,1,2}. Such a word is called \"squarefree\" if it contains no sub-block of the form XX, where X is a nonempty contiguous block. A word x is extremal if it is squarefree, but every possible insertion of a single letter, that is, every word of the form x' a x'' with x = x' x'', a in {0,1,2}, is not squarefree.",
