    "comment": [
        "The symmetry type of an undirected graph is determined by its automorphism group. It is a permutation group on the nodes set. Since every undirected graph may be understood as a directed graph with symmetric edges, the automorphism group of a graph with n nodes is always an automorphism group of a digraph with the same nodes size. Therefore A343592 is an upper bound for this sequence."

        "The cycle types of the automorphism groups enable to compute the possibilities to mark a subset of the nodes. With the results 5,9,12,6,8,10 we get 2*(5+9+12+6+8)+10 = 90 = A000666(4), what can be interpreted as the number of undirected graphs with loop edges."
