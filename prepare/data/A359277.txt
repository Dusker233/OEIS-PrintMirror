        "This is the first of three sequences that partition the positive integers. Taking u = A026430 and v = 1 + A285953 (which is A285953 except for its initial 1), the three sequences are (1)  u ^ v = intersection of u and v (in increasing order); (2)  u ^ v'; and (3)  u' ^ v.  The limiting density of each of these is 1/3."
