        "This sequence is the list of indices k such that A337496(k)=3.",
        "Conjecture: this sequence is finite and full. a(26) > 3.8*10^12 if it exists.",
        "All terms of this sequence increased by 1 are either prime numbers, or prime numbers squared, or 2 times a prime number because if b is a strict divisor of k+1, the digit for the units in the expansion of k in base b is b-1 so it must be 2 or the third base. In fact k+1 could have been equal to 8=2*4 but 7 is not a term of the sequence (7 = 111_2 = 21_3 = 13_4 = 7_8)."

        "a(7)=18 because there are only 3 bases (2, 19 and 3) which satisfy the condition of the definition (18=200_3) and 18 is the seventh of these numbers."
