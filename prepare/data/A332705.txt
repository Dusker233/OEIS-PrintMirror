    "comment": [
        "The values are established based on the following observation: A stage-0 Menger sponge has 6 faces (a cube). Note that a face here corresponds to the unit face of a unit cube used to construct the Menger sponge. This means that counting the faces is equivalent to computing the surface area. After that, a stage-n Menger sponge is created by replacing each of the 20 cubes of the stage-1 Menger sponge with a stage-(n-1) Menger sponge. Each of the 8 stage-(n-1) sponges on the corner loses 3 sides of outer faces (which represents a total of 8^(n-1) faces).  Each of the 12 stage-(n-1) Menger sponges on the edges (between the corners) lose two sides of outer faces. Thus the recurrence formula given below."
