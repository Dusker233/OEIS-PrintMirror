    "comment": [
        "This sequence stems from the property of the multinomial function that states that multinomial(p*a + r, p*b + s, p*c + t, p*d + u) = multinomial(a, b, c, d) * multinomial(r, s, t, u) mod p for all a >= 0, b >= 0, c >= 0, d >= 0, and r, s, t, u in the set {0, 1, ..., p-1}. a(n) is the number of such 4-tuples (r, s, t, u) for which this congruence also holds modulo p^2 for all a >= 0, b >= 0, c >= 0, and d >= 0, where p is the n-th prime.",
        "Equivalently, a(n) is the number of 4-tuples (r, s, t, u) of integers such that 0 <= r, s, t, u <= p-1 and either H(r) = H(s) = H(t) = H(u) = H(r + s + t + u) mod p, where H(n) is the n-th harmonic number and p is the n-th prime, or r + s + t + u >= 2*p. Note that the former case here implies that r + s + t + u <= p-1, as otherwise the expression H(r + s + t + u) mod p would be undefined. This restriction shows why these two cases can never overlap."
