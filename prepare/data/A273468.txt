    "comment": [
        "A graph is called rigid if, when we fix the length of each edge, it has only finitely many embeddings in the plane. A graph is called minimally rigid (or a Laman graph) if there is no edge that can be omitted while keeping the rigidity property. Laman graphs can be constructed by applying successively Henneberg moves (of type I or type II), starting with the graph that consists of two vertices joined by an edge. Here we consider Laman graphs that can be obtained by using only Henneberg type I moves, which means: adding one vertex and joining it with two different existing vertices."
