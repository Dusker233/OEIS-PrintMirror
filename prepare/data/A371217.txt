        "With this card trick the magician's assistant gets n cards from a deck, hides one card, and displays the rest, where it is allowed to place some of the displayed cards face down. After that, the magician guesses the hidden card.",
        "The trick for n = 4 was invented by Colm Mulcahy and is a variation of the Fitch Cheney trick. Surprisingly, the largest possible deck is the standard deck of 52 cards."
