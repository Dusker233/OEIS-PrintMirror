        "2^31 is a term, as is every integer of the form 2^31*p, 2^31*p^3, and 2^31*p*q, where p and q are distinct odd primes; each of these has 32, 64, or 128 divisors. Of the first 10000 terms, 9609 are of one of those forms. Of the remaining 391 terms, 316 are of the form 2^8 * 3^17 * m, where m is 1, a prime > 3, or 5^4. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Aug 13 2022"
