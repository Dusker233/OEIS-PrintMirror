        "Consider _Thomas Scheuerle_'s graph of A109812 for n = 0..10^7. It seems that the graph looks like a mixture of a graph of the sequence of first differences of a cellular automaton with recurrences and fractal-like structure (for example, A139251) and _Colin Mallows_'s plot of the first 10000 terms of Recam\u00e1n's sequence A005132."
