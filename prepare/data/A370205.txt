        "Every term has 2 odd divisors and has the form 2^k * p, k > 0, p prime and 2 < p < 2^(k+1), and therefore is a subsequence of A082662. The two 1's in row a(n) of the triangle of A237048 occur in positions 1 and p up to the diagonal since p <= floor( (sqrt(8*a(n) + 1) - 1)/2 ) < 2^(k+1) which represents the unimodal width pattern 121 in SRS(a(n)).",
