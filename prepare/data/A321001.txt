        "Since the so-called beastly primes (containing the digit string 666) were mentioned recently in a Numberphile video (see link), I guess it is now OK to include these numbers (which are based on the old convention that your fax number was one more than your telephone number) in the OEIS.",
        "Note that there is no analog of A232448, because 1 0^k 667 0^k 1 is always divisible by 3 and is never prime."
