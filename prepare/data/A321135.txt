        "Let p_14(n) be the product of the digits of n in base 14. We can define an equivalence relation DP_14 on n by n DP_14 m if and only if p_14(n) = p_14(m); the naming DP_b for the equivalence relation stands for \"digits product for representation in base b\". A number n is called the class representative number of class n/DP_14 if and only if p_14(n) = p_14(m), m >= n; i.e., the smallest number of that class; it is also called the reduced number.",
