        "A sequence of integers is unimodal if it is the concatenation of a weakly increasing and a weakly decreasing sequence. It is co-unimodal if its negation is unimodal.",
        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions."
