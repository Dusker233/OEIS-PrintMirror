        "Except for a(2) = 4, the terms of A066466 have form 2^k*p where p is odd prime and both 2^(k+1)*p-1, 2^(k+1)*p+1 are prime (i.e., twin primes). In other words, this sequence, omitting 4, is a subsequence of A040040 containing elements of the form 2^k*p with prime p.",
        "Furthermore, since 2^(k+1)*p-1, 2^(k+1)*p+1 must equal -1 and +1 modulo 3, the number 2^(k+1)*p must be 0 modulo 3, implying that p=3. Therefore every term, except 4, must be of the form 3*2^k such that 3*2^(k+1)-1, 3*2^(k+1)+1 are twin primes.",
        "According to these tables: http://www.prothsearch.com/riesel1.html and http://www.prothsearch.com/riesel2.html there are no other such k up to 18*10^6. Therefore a(6) (if it exists) is greater than 3*2^(18*10^6) ~= 10^5418540. (End)",
