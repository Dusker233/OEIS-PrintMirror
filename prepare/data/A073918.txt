        "Apparently the same as record values of A055734: least k such that phi(k) has n distinct prime factors, where phi is Euler's totient function. If the Mathematica program is used for large n, then \"fact\" should be reduced to, say, 1.1 in order to increase the search speed. - _T. D. Noe_, Dec 17 2003"
