    "comment": [
        "Let G, the group of rotations in 4 dimensional space, act on the set of n! paintings of each convex regular 4-polytopes having n cells. There are n! fixed points in the action table since the only element in G that leaves a painting fixed is the identity element. The order of G is A273509/2. So by Burnside's Lemma a(n)=n!/|G|. a(5) = 120!/7200 and a(6) = 600!/72000 and they are too large to display.",
