        "For given n > 9, consider integers k whose number of digits equals the sum of digits of n minus its last digit. If (d[i])_{i=1..N} are the digits of n, let S(n,k) be the result of inserting d[i] digits of k after the i-th digit of n, i = 1, ..., N-1. If S(n,k) is divisible by k, then n is called a stuffable number. Let s(n) be the set of all such k, for given n. If s(n) has m elements, then n is called m-stuffable. If n is in s(n), n is called self-stuffable. See A322323 for the list of all self-stuffable numbers.",
        "More generally, any n = 10^r + s with 0 <= s <= 9 is in the sequence, since it can be \"stuffed\" with k = 1, i.e., S(n,1) = 11*10^r + s is divisible by 1.",
