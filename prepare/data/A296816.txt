        "A variation of the Hofstadter-Conway $10,000 sequence (A004001). See antisymmetric humps (between its generational boundaries) of a(n) - n/2 in Links section. More precisely, the k-th generation of this sequence begins at 3*2^(k-3) + 2 for k > 2. Similar sequences can be created by generalized recurrence a_i(n) = a_i(a_i(n-1)) + a_i(n-a_i(n-i)) with i + 1 initial conditions a_i(1) = a_i(2) = ... = a_i(i+1) = 1. See also an illustration about this sequence family for i <= 10 in Links section."
