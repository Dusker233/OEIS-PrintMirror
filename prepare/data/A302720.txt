        "Let A,B,X represent A288189, A295185, A056240 respectively. A(p) is defined for every prime, B(p) is defined for primes >= 5. For a prime p with index k >= 3, A(p) = X(t)(rp-t) for some multiple r of p, and some integer t such that rp-t is prime. Then Sopfr(A(p)) = Sopfr(X(t))+(rp-t) = t+rp-t = rp. B(p) = X(g)(p-g) where g = p-q for some prime q = p-g < p.  q is the greatest prime divisor of A295185(p), so Sopfr(B(p)) = p. A(p) < B(p) if r and t exist such that (rp-t) is prime, with X(t)(rp-t) < X(g)(p-g). A(p) is computed from the list of possible values in the list of inequalities: 3(2p-3) < 2(3p-2) < 5(2p-5) < 2(5p-2) < ... < X(g)(p-g), selecting the first (smallest) value of (rp-t) which is prime. If such a term exists and is < X(p)(p-g), then A(p) < B(p) and p is in this sequence. Otherwise A(p) = B(p) = X(p)(p-g) and p is in A299760."
