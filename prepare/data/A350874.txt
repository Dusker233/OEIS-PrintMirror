    "comment": [
        "Equivalently (by symmetry), a(n) also equals the number of nonisomorphic right-alternative magmas with n elements (that is, magmas satisfying the identity x(yy) = (xy)y for all x and y)."

        "There are 10 non-isomorphic magmas with 2 elements, and 5 of these are left-alternative, so a(2) = 5."
