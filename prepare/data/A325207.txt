    "comment": [
        "A preimage constraint on a function is a set of nonnegative integers such that the size of the inverse image of any element is one of the values in that set. View a labeled rooted tree as an endofunction on the set {1,2,...,n} by sending every non-root node to its neighbor that is closer to the root and sending the root to itself. Thus, a(n) is the number of endofunctions on a set of size n with exactly one cyclic point and such that each preimage has at most 8 entries."
