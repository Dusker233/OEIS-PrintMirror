        "If a(n) is even, then 2*a(n)-1 is not a square by considering mod 4. Then 2*a(n) must be square, so a(n) is itself twice a square. Next, if a(n) is odd, then 2*a(n) is not a square. So 2*a(n)-1 is a square, and then a(n) is a sum of consecutive squares. This also shows that a(n) is expressible as a sum of two squares, and so is a subsequence of A001481. - _Elvar Wang Atlason_, Jul 25 2021"
