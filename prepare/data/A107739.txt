        "An n^2 X n^2 sudoku is an n^2 X n^2 array which is subdivided into n^2 n X n subarrays. Each row and column of the full array must contain each of the numbers 1 ... n^2 exactly once (this makes it a Latin square of order n^2). In addition, each of the n^2 n X n subarrays must also contain each of the numbers 1 ... n^2 exactly once."
