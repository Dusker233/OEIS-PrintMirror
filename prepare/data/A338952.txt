        "Each chiral pair is counted as two when enumerating oriented arrangements. The Schl\u00e4fli symbol of the 24-cell is {3,4,3}. It has 24 octahedral facets. It is self-dual. There are 576 elements in the rotation group of the 24-cell. They divide into 20 conjugacy classes. The first formula is obtained by averaging the edge (or face) cycle indices after replacing x_i^j with n^j according to the P\u00f3lya enumeration theorem.",
