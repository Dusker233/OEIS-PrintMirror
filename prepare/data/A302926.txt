        "If F(k) is the k-th Fibonacci number, where F(0)=0, F(1)=1, and F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2), then p(k)=F(k-1)/2^k is a normalized probability distribution on the positive integers.",

        "The n-th moments about zero of this distribution, known as raw moments, are defined by a(n) = Sum_{k>=1} (k^n)p(k). They also appear to be integers and form sequence A302922.",
        "For n >= 1, the raw moments also appear to be even. Dividing them by 2 gives sequence A302923.",
        "The central moments (i.e., the moments about the mean) also appear to be integers. They form sequence A302924.",
        "For n >= 1, the central moments also appear to be even. Dividing them by 2 gives sequence A302925.",
