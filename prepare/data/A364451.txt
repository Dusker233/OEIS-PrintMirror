    "comment": [
        "Peg duotaire is an impartial normal-play two-player game played on a simple graph, in which each vertex starts with a peg in it. If all vertices have a peg (i.e. the first turn), a move consists of removing some peg from a vertex.",
        "If some vertex does not have a peg, then a move hops one peg over another, landing in an adjacent hole and removing the jumped peg. Formally, it is three vertices x, y, z where x, y are adjacent and y, z are adjacent, and x, y have pegs and z does not. After the move, x, y do not have pegs and z does.",
        "Note than this sequence is always less than or equal to the number of trees of diameter 4 with n vertices, see A000094."
