        "273 is the smallest maximally idempotent integer.  Factorization is (3,7,13).  Bipartite factorizations are (3,91), (7,39), (13,21).  Lambda(273) = 12, (2*90),(6*38) and (12*20) are all divisible by 12, thus 273 is maximally idempotent.  The same is true for 455 = 5*7*13.  The next entry in the sequence, 1729=7*13*19, is a Carmichael number, but most Carmichael numbers are not maximally idempotent."
