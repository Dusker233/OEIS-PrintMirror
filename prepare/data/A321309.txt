        "The entries are known to be integers, they are conjectured to be nonnegative and increasing starting from index 2. The radius of convergence of the generating function is at least (sqrt(2)-1)/2 and at most 1.",
        "C(p) is also the speed of the front of the infinite-bin model with moves following a geometric distribution of parameter p."
