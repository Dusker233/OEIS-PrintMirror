    "comment": [
        "For an 8 X 8 magic square composed of 64 consecutive primes, it is necessary that the sum of these primes is a multiple of 16.",
        "This sequence consists of even integers equal to the sum of 64 consecutive primes divided by 8. It is not known whether each such set of consecutive primes can be arranged into an 8 X 8 magic square but it looks plausible.",
        "From _A.H.M. Smeets_, Jan 20 2021: (Start)",
        "Except from the condition that a magic constant exists, it must be an even magic constant due to the fact that the order is even, which explains why the sum of primes must be divisable by 16.",
        "The number of possible combinations of 8 primes out of the 64 consecutive primes added results in the magic constant is such that in almost all cases such a magic square existsts. However, as n increases, the diversity in prime gaps between the 64 consecutive primes increases, and thus the probability that a potential magic constant will lead to a magic square configuration will decrease. The challenge here seems to be to find a potential magic constant which has no magic square configuration. (End)"
