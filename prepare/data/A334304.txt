        "Take the edge graph of an n-dimensional cube and replace each of its (n-1) dimensional facets with a complete graph. The edges of this graph are then oriented so that no cycles are formed. a(n) is the number of different ways to do this with results that are not rotations of reflections of each other.",
        "For n<=3, a(n) is the number of reference elements needed when using the finite element method for an n-dimensional problem with tensor product cells if the orientations of the mesh entities are derived from a low-to-high ordering of the vertex numbers."
