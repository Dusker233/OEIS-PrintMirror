        "At sequence A076933, the question is asked: \"What is the longest string of ones in this sequence?\" As A076933(4*n) is rarely 1, such a string is not very long. The longest starting below 4*10^8 has length 6 and starts at 141. Checking multiples of 4 may help in finding longer such strings.",
        "Terms are also a multiple of 8. Proof: If m = 8*k + 4 then its divisors are 1, 2, 4 (and maybe 3). After dividing by 4 we have a fraction with denominator 2. Before that we did not see 1."

    "example": [
        "The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4 and 8. Dividing from left to right gives 8/1 = 8, 8/2 = 4, 4/4 = 1, and then 1/8 isn't an integer so as the last integer we see is 1, 8 is in the sequence."
