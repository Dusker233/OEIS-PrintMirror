        "To overlap \"regularly\", the two pentagons must line up on their vertices. This means that the overlapping region will also be an equilateral polygon and that it will have an even number of sides (half from each of the original pentagons), and will have all but two of its internal angles equal to (3*Pi)/5, as all but two of the angles will be angles from the original regular pentagons.",
