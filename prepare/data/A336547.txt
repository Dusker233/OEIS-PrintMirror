        "All even perfect numbers (even terms of A000396) are included in this sequence. In general, for any perfect number n in this sequence, map k -> A026741(sigma(k)) induces on its unitary prime power divisors (p^e||n) a permutation that is a single cycle, mapping each one of them to the next larger one, except that the largest is mapped to the smallest one. Therefore, for a hypothetical odd perfect number n = x*a*b*c*d*e*f*g*h to be included in this sequence, where x is Euler's special factor of the form (4k+1)^(4h+1), and a .. h are even powers of odd primes (of which there are at least eight distinct ones, see P. P. Nielsen reference in A228058), further constraints are imposed on it: (1) that h < x < 2*a (here assuming that a, b, c, ..., g, h have already been sorted by their size, thus we have a < b < ... < g < h < x < 2*a, and (2), that we must also have sigma(a) = b, sigma(b) = c, ..., sigma(f) = g, sigma(h) = x, and sigma(x) = 2*a. Note that of the 400 initial terms of A008848, only its second term 81 is a prime power, so empirically this seems highly unlikely to ever happen.",
