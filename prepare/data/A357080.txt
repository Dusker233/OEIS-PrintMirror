    "comment": [
        "Suppose k has m digits, then the sum of the digits of k multiplied by the sum of the digits of k^2 is bounded by 9m times 9*(2m), which equals 162m^2. On the other hand, k is greater than 10^(m-1), which grows much faster than 162m^2. It follows that k can't have more than 4 digits."

        "The sum of the digits of 80 is 8, the sum of the digits of 80^2 = 6400 is 10. The number 80 itself is 8*10. Thus, 80 is in this sequence."
