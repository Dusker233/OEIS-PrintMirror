        "For any n > 2, is it possible to construct an \"inside the box\" covering tree for any n X n X n set of points consisting of n^2 + n lines if n is even and n^2 + n + 1 lines if n is odd.",
        "In the special case of any 2 X 2 X ... X 2 points problem (k-times n), every optimal covering tree has (exactly) 2^(k-1) rectilinear segments, thus 2^(3-1) = 4 lines for the 2 x 2 x 2 case.",
        "If n = 3, then the (outside the box) solution is a(3) = 12, since such a connected arrangement of line segments has already been shown to exist, and this explicit upper bound matches 3^3 + 3. - _Marco Rip\u00e0_, Aug 25 2020",
        "Let n >= 5, we know that it is impossible to cover more than n^3 points with n^2 segments (trivial), and we need at least n segments to obtain a connected graph (otherwise, we cannot join more than n + h*(n - 1) points with h + 1 connected lines). Thus, assuming n > 2, the general lower bound is confirmed to be n^2 + n, therefore a(n even) = 4, 20, 42, 72, ..."
