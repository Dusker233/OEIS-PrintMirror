For example, 4 is written \"11\" in base 3, and \"11\" appears when the trailing zeros are removed from \"11000\", which is the term 108 written in base 3.",

Using standard arithmetic operations and any given prime p, this set can be derived from A268390 by dividing by p all the terms of A268390 whose squarefree part is a multiple of p and multiplying by p all the other terms of A268390."
