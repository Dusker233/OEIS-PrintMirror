    "comment": [
        "Replacing the shorter legs with the sum and absolute difference of the shorter legs may result in an integer-sided triangle, but this is not always the case. For example, {5,12,13}->{7,13,17} and {7,13,17} are the sides of a triangle. However, {60,91,109}->{31,109,151}, but {31,109,151} are not the sides of a triangle. If the replacement results in such a triangle, then the triangle is a scalene integer triangle (A070112) with sides of prime length, and a(n) is a term of A070081.",
