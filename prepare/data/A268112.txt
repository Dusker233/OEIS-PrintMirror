        "The sequence contains numbers k for which there is a prime p < k with v_p(H_k) >= 3, where v_p(x) is the p-adic valuation of x and H_k is the k-th Harmonic number. All numbers were found by D. W. Boyd. The corresponding p for a(1) through a(4) is 11 while for a(5) (in the b-file) is 83. [Edited by _Petros Hadjicostas_, May 25 2020]",
        "It is a widely believed conjecture that there is no pair of an integer k and a prime p for which v_p(H_k) >= 4. If variations of this conjecture hold, then Krattenhaler and Rivoal (2007-2009) would be able to establish some formulas for their theory.
