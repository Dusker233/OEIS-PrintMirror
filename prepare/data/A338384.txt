    "comment": [
        "As the multiplicativity of tau(k) ensures an infinity of solutions to the general equation m = k*tau(k) (see A338382), Richard K. Guy asked if, as for k*sigma(k) = q*sigma(q) (A337875, A337876), k*tau(k) = q*tau(q) has an infinity of primitive solutions, in the sense that (k', q') is not a solution for any k' = k/d, q' = q/d, d>1 (see reference Guy's book and 3rd example). The answer to this question seems not to be known today."
