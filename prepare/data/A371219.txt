        "This sequence is a subsequence of A371305. Every term m = 2^k * p * q * r in this sequence has 8 odd divisors and satisfies k > 0, p, q and r primes, 2 < p < 2^(k+1) < 2^(k+1) * p < q < p * q < 2^(k+1) * q < 2^(k+1) * p * q = floor( (sqrt(8 * m + 1) - 1)/2 ) = row(m) = r - 1. The equations state that the two central parts of SRS(m) meet at the diagonal.",
        "No term in this sequence can have the form 2^k * p * q^3 or 2^k * p^3 * q since either the central extent of width 0 is positive or it contradicts the initial uniform width pattern 1210."
