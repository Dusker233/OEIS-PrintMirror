        "This is one of the \"twin\" ratio-determined insertion sequences (RDIS) that are \"children\" in the next generation below the \"parent\" sequences I(0.25024) (A004253) and I(0.26816) (A001353) in the recurrence tree of RDIS sequences. The RDIS twin of this sequence is A085349. See the link for an explanation of RDIS twin. See A082630 or A082981 for other recent examples of RDIS sequences."
