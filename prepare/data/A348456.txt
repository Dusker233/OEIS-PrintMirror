        "The board has 4*n^2 squares. The colors of the squares do not matter. The two parts are rook-connected polygons of area 2*n^2. They do not need to be the same polygon, only that they have the same area.",

Manuel Kauers computed the [1,2] entry of the 9th power of that matrix. The desired number a(4) is half of the coefficient of z^32 in that entry. - _Doron Zeilberger_, May 04 2022",
