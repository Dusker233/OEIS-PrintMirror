        "For primes p, m^(2^v(p-1)+1) == m (mod p) has exactly 2^v(p-1) + 1 solutions modulo p. This sequence gives that composite numbers that satisfy this condition.",
        "Even terms are powers of 2 that are greater than or equal to 4. For odd k, k is a term if and only if k is of one of the two forms: (i) k = p^e for odd primes p and odd e >= 3; (ii) k = (p_1)^(e_1) * (p_2)^(e_2), p_1 == p_2 == 3 (mod 4), k == 9 (mod 16).",
        "Proof: Let k = (p_1)^(e_1)*(p_2)^(e_2)*...*(p_r)^(e_r) be an odd number. Write d = v(k-1). It is easy to see that the number of solutions to m^(2^d+1) == m (mod (p_i)^(e_i)) is 1 + gcd(2^d, (p_i-1)*(p_i)^(e_i)).",
        "If r = 1, then k = p^e is in this sequence if and only if (p-1)*p^(e-1) is divisible by 2^v2(p^e-1), or equivalently, v2(p-1) >= v2(p^e-1). So k = p^e is in this sequence if and only if e >= 3 is odd.",
        "If r >= 2, then k is in this sequence if and only if Product_{i=1..r} (1 + gcd(2^d, (p_i-1)*(p_i)^(e_i))) = 2^d + 1. Hence gcd(2^d, (p_i-1)*(p_i)^(e_i)) < 2^d for 1 <= i <= k. By Zsigmondy's Theorem, unless d = 3, 2^d + 1 has a primitive prime factor p such that p does not divide 2^e + 1 for all e < d. So we must have d = 3 (otherwise p does not divide Product_{i=1..r} (1 + gcd(2^d, (p_i-1)*(p_i)^(e_i)))), then r = 2 and gcd(2^d, (p_1-1)*(p_1)^(e_1)) = gcd(2^d, (p_1-1)*(p_1)^(e_1)) = 2. In conclustion, k is in this sequence if and only if r = 2, p_1 == p_2 == 3 (mod 4), k == 9 (mod 16)."
