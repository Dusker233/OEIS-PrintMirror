    "comment": [
        "By \"permutation of { 0 .. n-1 }\" we mean a string of n distinct digits. \"The last\" means the permutation which occurs for the first time later than all other permutations.",
        "Position = k means that the string starts with the digit corresponding to the weight n^-k; e.g., the first digit after the decimal point has position 1."
