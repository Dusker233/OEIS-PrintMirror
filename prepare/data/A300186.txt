        "Trivially, 1 < a(n) < 9*n = A008591(n). The lower bound follows, since a prime > 10 must contain at least two nonzero digits, with the least possible digit sum 2. The upper bound follows because 10^n-1 is always composite and thus the digit sum can be at most A017257(n-1). The maximal possible value is reached by a(n) iff a term t exists in A263431 such that A055642(t) = n-1."
