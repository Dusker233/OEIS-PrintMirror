        "A generalized Lucas sequence {U(m)} is a sequence defined by U(0) = 0, U(1) = 1 and U(m) = P*U(m-1) - Q*U(m-2) for m >= 2, where P > 0, gcd(P, Q) = 1 and (P, Q) != (1, 0), (1, 1) or (2, 1). The discriminant is D = P^2 - 4*Q.",
        "A primitive factor of U(m), m > 0 is any prime that divides U(m) but does not divide U(r) for any 0 < r < m. Let's call a prime factor of U(m) \"strongly primitive\" if it is primitive and does not divide D.",
        "Bilu, Hanrot and Voutier shows that for (P, Q, D) != (1, 2, -7), if U(m) has no strongly primitive factor, than m = 1..8, 10 or 12 (except for a few cases, m can only be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6. See A285314). (P, Q, D) = (1, 2, -7) is the only case where U(13), U(18) and U(30) have no primitive factor.",
        "This is also the only case where there are nine terms without a primitive factor. The case (P, Q, D) = (1, 3, -11) has five (m = 1, 2, 5, 6, 12). (1, -1, 5) has four (m = 1, 2, 6, 12). (1, 5, -19) has four (m = 1, 2, 7, 12). For all other Lucas sequences there can be at most three terms without a primitive factor (e.g. m = 1, 2, 6 for (3, 2, 1)).",
