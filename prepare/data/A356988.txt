        "This is the second sequence in a family of nested-recurrent sequences with apparently similar structure defined as follows. Given a sequence s = {s(n) : n >= 1} we define the k-th iterated sequence s^[k] by putting s^[1](n) = s(n) and setting s^[k](n) = s^[k-1](s(n)) for k >= 2. For k >= 1, we define a nested-recurrent sequence, dependent on k, by putting u(1) = 1 and setting u(n) = n - u^[k](n - u^[k+1](n-1)) for n >= 2. This is the case k = 2. For other cases see A006165 (k = 1), A356989 (k = 3) and A356990 (k = 4).",
