    "name": "Consider the family of configurations E where E(0) consists of a single equilateral triangle, and for any k >= 0, E(k+1) is obtained by applying the Equithirds substitution to E(k). For k >= 5, the central node of E(k) has 6 equivalent tetravalent neighbors; let t(k) be the coordination sequence for one of those tetravalent nodes. This sequence is the limit of t(k) as k goes to infinity.",
