        "A truncated triangular number is a figurate number, the number of dots in a hexagonal diagram where the side lengths alternate between two values. Include a number in this list if there are two different side-length pairs that give the same count.",
        "The underlying quadratic form is (4ab + a(a-3) + b(b-3) + 2)/2; n is in the list if n can be expressed in this form in two different ways, where a <= b. (That is, exchanging a and b is not considered different.)",
