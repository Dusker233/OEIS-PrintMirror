        "A conference matrix of order k is a k X k {-1,0,+1} matrix A such that A A' = (k-1)I.",
        "If k == 2 (mod 4) then a necessary condition is that k-1 is a sum of 2 squares (A286636). It is conjectured that this condition is also sufficient. If k == 2 (mod 4) and k-1 is a prime or prime power the condition is automatically satisfied."
