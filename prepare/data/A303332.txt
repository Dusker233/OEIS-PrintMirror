        "It follows from Theorem 6.3 of de Weger's tract that there are exactly 40 terms, the largest of which is 4375 = 1 + 4374 = 5^4 * 7 = 1 + 2 * 3^7.",
        "Indeed, de Weger determined all solutions of the equation x + y = z with x, y, z 13-smooth, x, y relatively prime and x <= y; there exist exactly 545 solutions.",
        "Among them, exactly 63 solutions consist of 7-smooth numbers, which yields exactly 40 terms of this sequence."
