        "The prime factors of 10^m + 1 are also prime factors of 10^km + 1, where k is odd, so a(n) and a(km) have those prime factors in common.",
        "Expanding on the comment in A083359 regarding finding large terms, we can generate large doublet terms in the following way:",
        "-- for any composite number M = 10^m + 1 try to compose a prime number p of length m from the prime factors of M. Generally this will require the factors to overlap to reduce the length to m.",
        "-- the factors can wrap around to the beginning of p. For example, if M has a factor of 137 then p can be of the form 7...13.",
        "-- the term is formed by concatenating p with itself to form a(n) = p||p. The resulting number will consist entirely of the concatenation of its prime factors with allowed overlap as in A083359."
