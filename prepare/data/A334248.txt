        "a(n) is the number of acyclic orientations of the edges of an n-dimensional cube, with rotations and reflections of the same orientation not counted.",
        "Except for n=0 and n=2, a(n) can be obtained by substituting -1 for x in the chromatic polynomials given in A334358. This fails for n = 2 because the square when folded diagonally gives a graph with an odd number of vertices. The contribution from this graph needs to be negated when determining the number of acyclic orientations. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Apr 24 2020"
