        "Terms in this sequence have at least 7 digits in base 6, i.e., are larger than 6^6, since sum(d_i 6^i) = sum(d_i) (mod 5), and 0+1+2+3+4+5 is divisible by 5. So the smallest ones should be of the form \"101....\" in base 6, where \"....\" is a permutation of \"2345\". Actually there is only one such prime, cf. examples."

        "The next smallest such prime is \"1023345\"[6]; note that here the \"3\" is repeated, since there is no such prime of the form \"102wxyz\" with w=0, 1 or 2. (Using the same reasoning as in the comment, it follows that the (7-digit base-6 pandigital) number has the same parity as the repeated digit, which therefore must be odd to get a prime.)"
