        "Let k be a nonnegative integer such that F(k) = 2^(2^k) + 1 is prime (a Fermat prime A019434), then m = (F(k)-1)*F(k)/2 appears in the sequence.",

        "The sequence has 5 (known) terms in common with sequences A055708 (k-1 | sigma(k)) and A056006 (k | sigma(k)+2) since {a(n)} is a subsequence of both.",

        "A term m of this sequence multiplied by a prime p not dividing it is abundant if and only if p < m-1. For each of a(2..5) there is such a prime near this limit (here: 7, 127, 30197, 2147483647) such that a(k)*p is a primitive weird number, cf. A002975. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 19 2016",
        "Any term m of this sequence can be combined with any term j of A088831 to satisfy the property (sigma(m) + sigma(j))/(m+j) = 2, which is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for two numbers to be amicable. [Proof: If m = a(n) and j = A088831(k), then sigma(m) = 2m-2 and sigma(j) = 2j+2. Thus, sigma(m) + sigma(j) = (2m-2) + (2j+2) = 2m + 2j = 2(m+j), which implies that (sigma(m) + sigma(j))/(m+j) = 2(m+j)/(m+j) = 2.] - _Timothy L. Tiffin_, Sep 13 2016",
