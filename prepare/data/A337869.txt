        "The number of walks on the simple square lattice that take one of the four directions U, D, R, L at each step and return to zero is zero if the number of steps is odd. If the number of steps is even, the sequence counts walks that start at (0,0), return to (0,0) and never pass through (0,0) or (1,0) in between.",
