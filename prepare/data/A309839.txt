        "Define the sequence a(n) = GAP_n to be the smallest integer that is not the dimension of a semisimple subalgebra of M_n(k). This is one more than the upper endpoint of the continuous region of M_n(k). Because when n = 1 there are no gaps, this sequence begins at n = 2. See Heikoop paper, page 31."
