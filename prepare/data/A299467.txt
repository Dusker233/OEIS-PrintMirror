        "67 is the third irregular prime. The corresponding entry for the first irregular prime 37 is A251782, and for the second irregular prime 59 is A299466.",
        "The p-adic digits of the unique simple zero of the p-adic zeta function zeta_{(p,l)} with (p,l)=(67,58) were used to compute the sequence (see the Mathematica program below). This corresponds with Table A.2 in Kellner (2007). The sequence is increasing, but some consecutive entries are identical, e.g., entries 22 / 23 and 84 / 85. This is caused only by those p-adic digits that are zero."
