        "The phi-representation of n is the (essentially) unique way to write n = Sum_{j=L..R} b(j)*phi^j, where b(j) is in {0,1} and -oo < L <= 0 <= R, where phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2, subject to the condition that b(j)b(j+1) != 1. The \"integer\" part is the string of bits b(R)b(R-1)...b(1)b(0), and its length is thus R+1.",
        "The gaps between consecutive terms are all either 0 or 1, and a gap of 1 occurs if and only if n = 1 or n = L(2i) or n = L(2i-1) + 1 for i >= 1. This is equivalent to Theorem 2.1 of Sanchis and Sanchis (2001)."
