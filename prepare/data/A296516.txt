        "Programs based on the direct application of the definition quickly reach a limitation by combinatorial explosion, hence this short list of values in section Data. The first conjectured formula (see Formulas) obtained by the observation of a pattern in the 2D shape of Q_n (as drawn in the Examples) is more computationally efficient and makes it possible to produce a significantly longer list of (nonguaranteed) values: see attached a-file in b-file format, section Links.",

At x=y=-1, P_n seems to give A000058 negated interleaved with -1's, while Q_n seems to give A007018 interleaved with the same sequence negated. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, May 22 2018"
