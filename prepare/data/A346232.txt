        "In order to derive the formulas below, the following two facts are useful. Let i, j be arbitrary nonnegative integers. (1) A segment with length slightly greater than sqrt(i^2+j^2) can touch i+j+3 squares, if it is aligned from (0,0) to (i,j) and then shifted a little. (2) For a given length, it suffices to consider segments aligned from (0,0) to either (i,i) or (i,i+1) (other orientations result in a smaller number of squares touched).",
        "The sequence is increasing, with a(n+1)-a(n) equal to 1 or 2. There can be no more than two consecutive increments equal to 1. Increments equal to 2 always appear isolated, except at the initial sequence terms (3,5,7). - _Luis Mendo_, Jul 29 2021"
