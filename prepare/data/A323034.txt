        "The graph of A321223 suggests there is a finite number of numbers k with a given number m of RSCPs (not all such k appear here). We know that A190900 (positive integers without RSCPs) is finite. For index i <= 2^16, there are 6 squares in A321223, i.e., those of {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}, that have just 1 RSCP; there are 120 nonsquares 3 <= k <= 590 in A321223 that have m = 1 RSCP. In the same range, there are 127 numbers 27 <= k <= 830 in A321223 that have m = 2 RSCPs, and 142 numbers 103 <= k <= 1280 in A321223 that have m = 3 RSCPs. This sequence includes many of the first terms k of these finite sequences, all k having m RSCPs.",

        "1. a(3) = 103 and a(23) = 2011 are the only primes.",

Only k in {1, 103, 175, 310, 838, 880, 2011, 2416, 4531, 4720, 5872, 11248, 11632, 12400, 15136, 16081, 19696, 20464, 29296, 40816, 51568, 52336} are congruent to 1 (mod 3); this of course includes both primes 103 and 2011.
