        "A way of writing n as a (nonnegative) linear combination of a finite sequence y is any sequence of pairs (k_i,y_i) such that k_i >= 0 and Sum k_i*y_i = n. For example, the pairs ((3,1),(1,1),(1,1),(0,2)) are a way of writing 5 as a linear combination of (1,1,1,2), namely 5 = 3*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 0*2. Of course, there are A000041(n) ways to write n as a linear combination of (1..n)."
