        "Apparently the number of grid points t(n) = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 14, 23, ...} (A357303) in the reduced representations as described in the examples matches t(n) = A087503(n-3) + 2  for n >= 3, i.e., t(n) = t(n-1) + 3*t(n-2) - 3*t(n-3) for n >= 5. This coincidence persists up to t(15) = 1823, but t(16) = 2553, whereas the recurrence predicts 3281, which is t(17). It seems that all of the terms generated by the recurrence also appear as record numbers of grid points. However, there are other record numbers in between, of which 2553 is the first occurrence."
