        "For k>1, the formula (prevprime(e^k)+nextprime(e^k))/2 either gives floor(e^k), for k = 61, 74, 2170, ..., or gives ceiling(e^k), for k = 3, 16, 91, 113, 1441, 1566, 2499, ... This partitions {a(n)}\\{1} into two subsequences each of which can be conjectured to have relative density 1/2.",
        "In cases k = 16, 61, 113, 2499, ... the distance is actually less than 0.5. Then the formula (prevprime(e^k)+nextprime(e^k))/2 yields round(e^k), the nearest integer to e^k."
