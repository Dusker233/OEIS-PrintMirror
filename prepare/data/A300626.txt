        "A free pure symmetric multifunction (with empty expressions allowed) f in EOME is either (case 1) a positive integer, or (case 2) a possibly empty expression of the form h[g_1, ..., g_k] where k >= 0, h is in EOME, each of the g_i for i = 1, ..., k is in EOME, and for i < j we have g_i <= g_j under a canonical total ordering of EOME, such as the Mathematica ordering of expressions.",
