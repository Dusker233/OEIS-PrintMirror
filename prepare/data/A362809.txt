        "The symmetric representation of sigma(k), SRS(k), of every term k in this sequence consists of at least 3 parts, with a(1) = 15 and a(5) = 5950 being the only ones among the first 11 terms for which the SRS consists of exactly 3 parts. A251820 is a subsequence. a(12) > 5*10^9.",
        "Suppose that a(n) = 2^i * q, i >= 0 and q odd. Because the first part of SRS(a(n)) has width 1, the smallest prime factor p of q satisfies p > 2^(i+1) -- see the locations of 1's in the triangle of A237048 and computation of widths in A249223. The area of the first part of SRS(a(n)) is (2^(i+1) - 1) * (q+1)/2 = (a(n) + 2^i) * (2^(i+1) - 1) / 2^(i+1) since the first part has 2^(i+1) - 1 legs (see the formula in A237591). Therefore, when 2^i * q is in the sequence then 2^j * q, for 0 <= j <= i is also. Sigma(a(n)) = A068156(i+1) * (a(n) + 2^i) / 2^(i+1).",
        "Conjecture: The area of the first part of SRS(n) being equal to sigma(n)/3 implies that the first part has width 1.",
        "This is true for all odd a(n) since their first part consists of a single leg of width 1. It also holds for even numbers through 10^7.",
        "Observation: Consider the known 11 terms. Apart from 5950 and 294910 the rest are also in A063906. Question: Is A063906 a subsequence? - _Omar E. Pol_, Jul 09 2023",
        "Answer: A063906 consists of the odd terms of this sequence since the first part of the symmetric representation of sigma for odd a(n) equals (a(n)+1)/2 which is equivalent to a(n) = 2*sigma(a(n))/3 - 1, i.e., a(n) is in A063906. - _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Jul 10 2023",
