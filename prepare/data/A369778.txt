        "For a transitive relation R on [n], let E = domain(R intersect R^(-1)) and let F = [n]\\E.  Let q(R) = R intersect E X E and let s(R) = R intersect F X F.  Let ~ be the equivalence relation on the set of transitive binary relations on [n] defined by: R_1 ~ R_2 iff q(R_1) = q(R_2) and s(R_1) = s(R_2).  Here, two transitive relations are inequivalent if they are in distinct equivalence classes under ~.  q(R) is a quasi-order (A000798) and s(R) is a strict partial order (A001035). See Norris link.",
