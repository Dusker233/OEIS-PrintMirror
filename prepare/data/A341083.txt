        "For D=29, the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 16. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 41, but the smallest x in this case is 6, which is less than 16. The next prime, D, after 41 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 61 and the least x for which it has a solution is 164, which is larger than 16, so it is a new record value. So 29 is a term of this sequence and 16 is the corresponding term of A341084, but 41 is not a term here because the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is not a record value.",
