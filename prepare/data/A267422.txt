        "The prime factors of the largest squarefree practical number with n prime factors are the first n members of a(n). The largest squarefree practical number with 3 prime factors is 78 = 2*3*13 and the largest squarefree practical number with 5 prime factors is 367580694 = 2*3*13*167*28219, etc.",
        "Because all primorial numbers (A002110) are practical, the prime factors of the smallest squarefree practical number with n prime factors are the first n members of the primes. Hence the smallest squarefree practical number with n prime factors is A002110(n). - _Frank M Jackson_, May 29 2023"
