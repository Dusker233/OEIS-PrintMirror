        "Consider the following game: two players make moves in turn, initially the number on the board is n, each move consists of subtracting a perfect square from the number on the board, the player who faces 0 loses. This sequence is the set of losing positions in this game. - Mikhail Dvorkin (mikhail.dvorkin(AT)gmail.com), Jan 27 2008",
        "This sequence was investigated by Golomb (1966), who proved that it is infinite. More strongly (as Ruzsa 1984 notes) the number of values up to any given n is at least proportional to sqrt(n). No two numbers in this sequence differ by a square, and this sequence can be defined as the lexicographically first (greedy) sequence with no square differences. It follows from the Furstenberg-S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy theorem (e.g., see S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy 1978) that its natural density is zero. - _David Eppstein_, Nov 20 2016"
