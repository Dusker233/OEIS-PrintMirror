    "comment": [
        "A packing coloring of a graph associates an integer color to every graph vertex in such a way that for any k > 0 if two different vertices share the same color k, they must be at distance at least k+1. a(n) is the minimal number of colors (1,2,3,...) needed to perform a packing coloration of an n-dimensional hypercube graph. Only the first terms, up to n = 8, are known. In contrast, the ordinary chromatic number of any hypercube is always equals 2, since any hypercube is a bipartite graph.",
        "There are no known exact formulas or recurrence relations. Some asymptotic results and bounds are given in the Formula section."
