        "If it can be shown that all iterations of A359194 eventually reach one of the terms of this sequence, it would prove that all such trajectories are finite.",

        "(1) If A359194(x) = a(k) for some a(k) < x, then x is also in the sequence.",
        "(2) The orbit of any x under iterations of A359194 is finite if and only if it reaches a term of this sequence.",
        "(3) No term has binary digits starting with '11...', i.e., all terms > 1 have binary digits starting '10...'.",
        "(4) If the 3rd binary digit of a(n) is a '1', it cannot be followed by another bit 1, so all terms > 5 have a binary representation of the form '100...' or '1010...'",
        "(5) A substring of '11', i.e., two consecutive bits 1, in a term of this sequence, is necessarily preceded by an earlier substring '00', i.e., two consecutive bits 0 to the left of the '11'. [This implies (3) and (4).] (End)"
