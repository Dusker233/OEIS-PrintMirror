    "comment": [
        "a(n) is from Appendix C of Thurber's 2002 paper, using the maximum from each row. At the time of publication, the bounds were known to be exact up to n=4. A357269 shows that they are also exact for n=5. This sequence is not to be confused with A069156, also from Thurber's Appendix C, which uses only the first column, making for looser bounds for n > 11. a(6), a(8), a(10), a(12), and a(16) are also conjectured to be exact."
