        "Due to the symmetry of the measure mu with respect to x=1/2 and the parity of the polynomial (x-1/2)^k about the line x=1/2, every odd entry is 0 and is thus omitted.",
        "The ternary Cantor measure, defined many ways, is the unique Borel measure mu on the unit interval [0,1] satisfying the following recurrence relation for any measurable set E: mu(E) = mu(phi_0(E))/2 + mu(phi_2(E))/2.  Here, for j in {0,1,2}, phi_j:[0,1] to [0,1] is the linear function which sends x in [0,1] to (x+j)/3.  For any nonnegative integer k, we define the k-th shifted moment J(k) to be the integral of (x-1/2)^k with respect to mu.  The described sequence J(0), J(1), J(2), ... is rational and this sequence a(0), a(1), a(2), ... is the sequence of numerators of J(0), J(2), J(4), ....",
        "For the purpose of computing J(k), we first compute the (unshifted) moments (see A308612 and A308613) which are the integrals of x^k rather than (x-1/2)^k, expand the polynomial (x-1/2)^k, replace each x^m term with the corresponding moment I(m), and simplify."
