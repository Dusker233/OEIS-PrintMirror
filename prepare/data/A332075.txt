        "It appears that about 1/log_10(N) of the odd numbers below 2N are in this sequence: for n < 10^k with k = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), there are (7, 51, 364, 2675, 20668, 167185) numbers as defined in NAME.",
        "We observe that the sequence mainly consists of the odd primes but some of them are missing (47, 67, 97, 107, 127, 137, 151, 167, ...) and there are some composite terms {25, 35, 49, 55, 77, 91, ...}.",
        "The frequency of primes in this sequence remains high: the least prime > 10^99 with this property is only 10^99 + 2191. See A332078 for primes not in this sequence.",
        "These are numbers of the form (p-2^m)*2^m + 1, where p is an odd prime and 1 < 2^m < p, so there are infinitely many such numbers. Problem: are there infinitely many primes of this form? All the numbers A016945 > 3 are not in this sequence. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Aug 13 2020",
