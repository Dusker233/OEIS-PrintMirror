        "Every term m is the sum of two 7-smooth numbers. Proof: Since (m-p) | m*p, we have m*p = (m - p)*k for some k > 0. Suppose m is not the sum of two 7-smooth numbers. Then m - p is not 7-smooth and so there exists a prime q > 7 such that q | (m - p). Since q doesn't divide p and q | (m - p) but (m - p) | m*p, we have q | m. But since q | m and q | (m - p) we have q | (m - (m - p)) = p, a contradiction. Q.e.d. - _David A. Corneth_, Jun 15 2020"
