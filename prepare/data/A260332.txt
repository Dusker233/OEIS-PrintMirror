        "According to Yang-Jiang (2021) these are the 5-Schroeder numbers. If confirmed, this will prove Michael Weiner's conjectures and enable us to extend the sequence. Yang & Jiang (2021) give an explicit formula for the m-Schroeder numbers in Theorem 2.4. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 28 2021",
        "By diamond-shaped poset with 4 vertices, we mean a poset on four elements with e_1 < e_2, e_1 < e_3, e_2 < e_4, e_3 < e_4, and no order relations between e_2 and e_3. In the Hasse diagram for such a poset, we have a least element, two elements in the level above, and one element in the top level, so the diagram resembles a diamond.  The associated permutation is the permutation obtained by reading the labels of each poset by levels left to right, starting with the least element.",
