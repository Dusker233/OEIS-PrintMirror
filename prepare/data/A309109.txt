        "The Pyraminx is a regular tetrahedron puzzle in the style of Rubik's Cube. The rotational axes of the pieces are perpendicular to the faces. As a result, the only rotation of the Pyraminx of size 2 is the trivial rotation of the tips (it is not the same as the Pyramorphix, which is totally a different puzzle). For n >= 3, see the Michael Gottlieb link below for an explanation of the term a(n)."
