    "comment": [
        "Consider the complete graph K_n whose n(n-1)/2 edges are colored with 3 distinct colors as to minimize the number of monochromatic triangles, i.e., subgraphs isomorphic to K_3 having all edges of the same color.",
        "Cummings et al. show that this minimum number of monochromatic triangles M_3(K_3,n) is given by a(n) for sufficiently large n.",
        "For the actual minimum numbers, we currently only know M_3(K_3,n) = 0 for n < 17, and M_3(K_3, 17) = 5.",
        "Known examples for n>17, where the actual minimum value is below this upper bound: M_3(K_3, 18) <= 10 < 14 = a(18), M_3(K_3, 19) <= 15 < 17 = a(19), M_3(K_3, 21) <= 25 < 26 = a(21). For n>21, the current best known minimum values match the upper bound. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Jul 01 2021"

The minimum number of monochromatic triangles in an edge-coloring of K_17 with 3 colors turns out to be 5 <= 11."
