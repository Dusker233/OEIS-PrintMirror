        "The bipartite graphs counted here arise as representations of certain types of calls in switching networks in which two callers can be in a call with an arbitrary number (n) of receivers, and where callers are distinguishable, but the receivers are not. In a more abstract setting, a left-labeled (2,n)-bipartite graph is a graph with two sets of non-overlapping vertices I and and O, where |I| = 2, |O| = n, and the two vertices in I are considered different (distinguishable), whereas the n vertices in O are considered interchangeable (indistinguishable). Our formula (sequence) gives the number of non-isomorphic graphs under these assumptions."
