        "Theorem: This sequence has g.f. G_1(x) = x^3/((1-x)^3*(1+x)*(1-x-x^2)) = x^3/(1-2*x-x^2+3*x^3-x^5), which implies a linear recurrence with constant coefficients and signature (3,-1,-4,3,1,-1).",

        "Let b(n) be the number of ordered subsequences S of {1,...,n} containing at least three elements, such that the first differences contain only odd numbers, and in which the largest term is n.",
        "Then the a(n) are the partial sums of the b(n), and we claim that b(n) has generating function (1-x)*G_1(x).",
        "We obtain a recurrence for b(n) as follows.",
        "If we remove n from the subsequence S, there are two possibilities. Either we obtain a subsequence of {1,...,n-i} with largest term n-r (r odd) containing at least three elements, or we obtain a pair j, n-r with r and n-r-j odd. In this case j can be chosen in floor((n-r)/2) ways.",
        "So, setting r = 2*i+1, we have shown that b(n) satisfies the recurrence",
        "b(n) = Sum_{i = 0..floor(n/2)-1)} (b(n-(2*i+1)) + floor((n-(2*i+1))/2)),",
