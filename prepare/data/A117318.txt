        "A flat polynomial is defined to be a polynomial whose coefficients are -1, 0, or 1. Order four means that n is the product of four odd primes p<q<r<s.",
        "For pqrs to be flat, it appears that three conditions on p < q < r < s are required: q = -1 (mod p), r = +-1 (mod pq), and s = +-1 (mod pqr). [_T. D. Noe_, Apr 13 2010]"
