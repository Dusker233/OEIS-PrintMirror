        "Take the family of correlated prime-indexed conjectures appearing in A343249 - A343253, in which an alternative formula for the p-adic order of positive integers is proposed. There, the general p-indexed conjecture says that v_p(n), the p-adic order of n, is given by the formula: v_p(n) = log_p(n / L_p(k0, n)), where L_p(k0, n) is the lowest common denominator of the elements of the set S_p(k0, n) = {(1/n)*binomial(n, k), with 0 < k <= k0 such that k is not divisible by p}. Evidence suggests that the primality of p is a necessary condition in this general conjecture. So, if a composite number q is used instead of a prime p in the proposed formula for the p-adic (now, q-adic) order of n, the first counterexample (failure) is expected to occur for n = q * a(i), where i is the index of the smallest prime that divides q."
