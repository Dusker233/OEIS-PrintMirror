    "comment": [
        "Consider the lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative integers that does not contain the arithmetic mean of any pair of terms (such sequences are called 3-free sequences as they do not contain 3-term arithmetic progressions): 0,1,3,4 and so on. This sequence is Stanley sequence S(0,1). Remove numbers in the Stanley sequence from nonnegative integers and repeat the process of finding the next earliest 3-free sequence, which is sequence A323398. We get this sequence on the next iteration.",
        "When represented in ternary this sequence consists of integers ending in 1 or 2, and there is exactly one digit 2 before that that might be followed by zeros."
