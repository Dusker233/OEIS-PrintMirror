        "We can use the Bacher numbers A368207 to measure the primeness of a positive integer, similar to how the number of prime factors of an integer does, but based on the number of representations of n as w*x + y*z with max(w, x) < min(y, z). Taking b(n) = 2*(Bacher(n) - sigma(n)) + n + 1 as the measure, Bacher's theorem shows that b(n) = 0 if n is an odd prime. Conversely, if b(n) = 0, we cannot conclude that n is prime as the example n = 35 shows, but this is probably the only exception.",
        "This sequence gives the integers k for which b(k) is positive, and A368459 provides those for which b(k) is negative.",
        "Apart from the first three terms, all terms are apparently odd semiprimes (A046315); they are odd composite numbers that cannot be divided by smaller composite numbers."
