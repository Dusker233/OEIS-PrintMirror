        "(i) Some Bogot\u00e1 numbers occur in pairs (such as 24 and 25). Are there infinitely many such pairs?",
        "(ii) More generally, can arbitrarily long sets of consecutive numbers be found all of which are Bogot\u00e1 numbers?",
        "(iii) Can the gap between two consecutive Bogot\u00e1 numbers be arbitrarily large? Answer: Yes.",
        "From _David A. Corneth_, Aug 06 2020: (Start)",
        "The only primes in this sequence are A004022.",
        "To see if a number is a Bogot\u00e1 number, we only have to look at its 7-smooth divisors. Proof: If a number k is a Bogot\u00e1 number then k = m*p(m) where p(m) is 7-smooth as it's a product of digits. Furthermore, if k = m*p(m) then p(m) | k. Q.e.d. Below is an example using this idea.",
        "To find Bogot\u00e1 numbers k up to N we can make a list of 7-smooth numbers up to sqrt(N) and list the factorizations into single-digit numbers of each of these 7-smooth numbers that when concatenated give m such that m * p(m) = k where p(m) is that 7-smooth number.",
        "For example, 10 is a 7-smooth number. Its factorizations into single-digit numbers are 2*5, 5*2, 1*2*5 and so on. This tells us that 10*25 = 250, 10*52 = 520, 10*125 = 1250 all are Bogot\u00e1 numbers.",
        "Similarily we can find odd Bogot\u00e1 numbers to then find consecutive Bogot\u00e1 numbers (See A336864). (End)"
