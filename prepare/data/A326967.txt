        "Alternatively, these are sets of subsets of {1..n} whose dual is a (strict) antichain, also called T_1 sets of subsets. The dual of a set of subsets has, for each vertex, one edge consisting of the indices (or positions) of the edges containing that vertex. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,3}} is {{1},{1,2},{2}}. An antichain is a set of sets, none of which is a subset of any other."
