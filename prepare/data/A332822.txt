        "If we take each odd term of this sequence and replace each prime in its factorization by the next smaller prime, we get the same set of numbers as we get from halving the even terms of this sequence, and A332821 consists exactly of those numbers. The numbers that are one third of the terms that are multiples of 3 are in A332820, which consists exactly of those numbers. The numbers that are one fifth of the terms that are multiples of 5 constitute A332821, and for larger primes, an alternating pattern applies as described in the previous paragraph.",
        "The product of any 2 terms of this sequence is in A332821, the product of any 3 terms is in A332820, and the product of a term of A332820 and a term of this sequence is in this sequence. So if a number k is present, k^2 is in A332821, k^3 is in A332820, and k^4 is in this sequence.",
        "If k is an even number, exactly one of {k/2, k, 2k} is in the sequence (cf. A191257 / A067368 / A213258); and generally if k is a multiple of a prime p, exactly one of {k/p, k, k*p} is in the sequence."
