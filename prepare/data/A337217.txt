        "This finite sequence a(n), for n = 1, 2, ..., 13, appears as eq. (2.3) given by Kaplansky on p. 87.",
        "It enters Theorem 2.1 of Kaplansky, p. 87, with proof on p. 90 (here reformulated): The positive integers uniquely represented by x^2 + y^2 + 2*z^2, with  0 <= x <= y and 0 <= z, consist of the 13 numbers a(n) and 4^k*6 = A002023(k), for integers k >= 0. See a comment in A002023 for this uniquely representable positive integers of this ternary form.",
