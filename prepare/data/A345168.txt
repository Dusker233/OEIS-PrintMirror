        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.",
        "A sequence is alternating if it is alternately strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, starting with either. For example, the partition (3,2,2,2,1) has no alternating permutations, even though it does have the anti-run permutations (2,3,2,1,2) and (2,1,2,3,2)."
