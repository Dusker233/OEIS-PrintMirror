    "comment": [
        "Because asymptotically the size of the partition number function p(n) ~ O(exp(sqrt(n))), and the probability of primality of p(n) ~ O(1/sqrt(n)) and the combined probability of primality of p(n) and p(n)+-4 is ~ O(1/n), the sum of the prime probabilities is diverging and there are no obvious restrictions on primality; therefore this sequence may be conjectured to be infinite.",
