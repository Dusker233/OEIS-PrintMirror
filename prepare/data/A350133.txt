    "comment": [
        "The Riemann series theorem tells us that we can rearrange the terms of the alternating harmonic series 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 ... to converge to any number. If we do so using a greedy algorithm to converge to 2, we start with the positive terms 1 + 1/3 + 1/5 + ... + 1/15 which is just over 2, then add the first negative term -1/2, then add 1/17 + 1/19 + ... + 1/41 which is just over 2, then add -1/4, and so on. We take the last denominator in each run as our sequence, so a(1) = 15, a(2) = 41, and so on.",
        "It appears that each subsequent term is either 26 or 28 more than the previous."
