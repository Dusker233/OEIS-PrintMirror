        "The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k).",
        "The differences of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were increasing, so for example the differences of (x, y, z) are (y - x, z - y). We adhere to this standard for integer partitions also even though they are always weakly decreasing. For example, the differences of (6,3,1) (with the last part taken to be 0) are (-3,-2,-1).",

        "This sequence and A025487, considered as sets, are related by the partition conjugation function A122111(.), which maps the members of either set 1:1 onto the other set. - _Peter Munn_, Feb 10 2022"
