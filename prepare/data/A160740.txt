        "On the infinite square grid we start at stage 0 with no toothpicks. Toothpicks have length 2. At stage 1 we place two consecutive toothpicks in the vertical direction and  two consecutive toothpicks in the horizontal direction forming a cross centered at the origin. At stage 2 we place four toothpicks. At stage 3 we place eight toothpicks. For more information about the toothpick sequences see A139250. - Omar E. Pol, Nov 24 2011"
