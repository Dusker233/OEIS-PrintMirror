        "a(n) is the smallest number of queens that can be placed on the diagonal of an n X n chessboard attacking all the cells on the chessboard. For large n the diagonal domination number exceeds the domination number.",
        "The diagonal dominating set can be described by the set X of the x-coordinates of all the queens. Cockayne and Hedetniemi showed that for n greater than 1, set X has to be the complement to a midpoint-free even-sum set. Here midpoint-free means that the set doesn't contain an average of any two of its elements. Even-sum means that each sum of a pair of elements is even. Thus the problem of finding the diagonal domination number is equivalent to finding a largest midpoint-free even-sum set in the range 1-n."
