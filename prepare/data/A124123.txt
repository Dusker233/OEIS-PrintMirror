        "The function f(p)=p/2 if p == 2 (mod 3), f(p)=2p otherwise, yields a half-integer for primes p=6k-1 and an even number for primes p=6k+1; in all cases nextprime(f(p)) is defined without ambiguity: f(p) will never be equal to a prime.",
        "This sequence lists primes p' not in the range of the map p -> nextprime(f(p)), defined on the primes.",
        "Equivalently, p' is listed iff: (i) no even number between p' and the next lower prime is of the form 2p with p=0 or p == 1 (mod 3), AND (ii) no half-integer between p' and the next lower prime is of the form p/2 with p == 2 (mod 3) and p prime (in both conditions).",

        "The function f is discussed in A138750. Composed with the nextprime function and restricted to the primes (cf. A138751), it yields a (\"natural\") variant of the Collatz function on the set of the primes, with (mod 2) replaced by (mod 3). The gb-sequences are the orbits under that function. - _M. F.
