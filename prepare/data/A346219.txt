    "comment": [
        "This is a variation of the sequence A346133. Similar rules are used to determine the allowed values of A and B - neither number can have a leading 0, and both cannot be palindromes. However the reverse of k may appear as in general any solutions for k and R(k) will occur in different bases.",
        "This sequence lists those base-10 numbers that meet these criteria in six or more bases, from base 2 to base 10. Note that, although k must stay the same when written in the different bases, the values of A and B need not be the same. Only the product of the chosen two factors and their reverses must equal k and R(k) in the given bases. See the example below and the linked data file.",
