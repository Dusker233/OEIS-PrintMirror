    "comment": [
        "Except for the prime sum of the single number 2 in the first row, all sums are equal to a twin prime.",
        "For row k, the k! sums produce as many distinct primes, or, for row k>=2, k!/2 distinct prime twins.",
        "Defining this exact triangle from an other angle, e.g. by discovering and describing a regularity in its structure, and/or proving its infinitude, is equivalent to proving the twin prime conjecture. An independent proof of the latter may not prove the infiniteness of this sequence, however."
