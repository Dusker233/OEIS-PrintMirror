        "The omega-sequence of an integer partition is the sequence of lengths of the multisets obtained by repeatedly taking the multiset of multiplicities until a singleton is reached. We define the omicron of an integer partition to be 0 if the partition is empty, 1 if it is a singleton, and otherwise the second-to-last part of its omega-sequence. For example, the partition (32211) has chain of multisets of multiplicities {1,1,2,2,3} -> {1,2,2} -> {1,2} -> {1,1} -> {2}, so its omega-sequence is (5,3,2,2,1), and its omicron is 2."
