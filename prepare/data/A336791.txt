The next prime, D, for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 59, but the smallest x in this case is 23, which is less than 59. The next prime, D, after 59 for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 67 and the least x for which it has a solution is 221, which is larger than 59, so it is a new record value. 67 is a term of A336790 and 221 is a term of this sequence, but 59 is not a term of A336790 because the least x for which x^2-47*y^2=-2 has a solution at D=59 is not a record value."
