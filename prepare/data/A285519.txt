        "From _Michel Dekking_, Feb 22 2021: (Start)",
        "Here is a proof of this conjecture. The limit of a(n)/n as n tends to infinity is equal to the inverse 1/f0 of the frequency f0 of the letter 0 in the sequence (a(n)) (see also the argument in A285401).",
        "From the Perron-Frobenius theorem we know that the frequency vector (f0,f1) is the normalized eigenvector associated to the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue lambda of the incidence matrix M of the generating morphism 0->11, 1->0101.",
        "Here M = | 0 2|",
        "         | 2 2|.",
        "The Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of M is lambda = 1+sqrt(5), and the vector [u,v]:= [2, 1+sqrt(5)] is an eigenvector with lambda. So",
        "       1/f0 = (u+v)/u = (3+sqrt(5))/2 = phi^2, where phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2.",
