        "By analogy with highly composite numbers (A002182), these numbers could be called highly Brazilian numbers.",
        "Also, records in A284758.",
        "The representation n = 11_(n-1) is allowed in A066044, but it is not allowed for Brazilian numbers. Hence 3 = 11_2 = A066044(2) is not Brazilian and therefore not highly Brazilian. However, except for 3, the sequences A066044 and this one are the same.",
