        "In general, assuming the strong form of RH, if 0 < a, b < k, gcd(a, k) = gcd(b, k) = 1, a is a quadratic residue and b is a quadratic nonresidue mod n, then Pi(k,b)(n) > Pi(k,a)(n) occurs more often than not, where Pi(k,b)(n) is the number of primes <= n that are congruent to b modulo k. This phenomenon is called \"Chebyshev's bias\". This sequence gives the primes p such that the smallest prime q to violate the inequality Sum_{primes r <= q} Kronecker(r,p) <= 0 is relatively large.",
