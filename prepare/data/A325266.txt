        "The adjusted frequency depth of a positive integer n is 0 if n = 1, and otherwise it is 1 plus the number of times one must apply A181819 to reach a prime number, where A181819(n = p^i*...*q^j) = prime(i)*...*prime(j) = product of primes indexed by the prime exponents of n. For example, 180 has adjusted frequency depth 5 because we have: 180 -> 18 -> 6 -> 4 -> 3.",
