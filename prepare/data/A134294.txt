    "comment": [
        "a(n) is the minimal degree of an equation from which n successive terms after the first can be removed (by a series of transformation comparable to Tschirnhaus's) without requiring the solution of at least one irreducible equation of degree greater than n. The cases where an equation of degree greater than n is needed but is in fact factorizable into several equations of degree all less than or equal to n are considered as fair. a(n) <= A000905(n) by definition."
