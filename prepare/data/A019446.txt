        "Here is a proof of the conjecture by Ivan N. Ianakiev. Let b = (b(n)) be the sequence of occurrences of the \"singleton terms\" in (a(n)). We have to show that b = A276885.",
        "In the following phi := (1+sqrt(5))/2 (so phi = tau).",
        "By its definition, the sequence (a(n)) is a generalized Beatty sequence with terms  a(n) = floor(phi*n)-n+1, since 1/phi = phi-1.  So by Lemma 8 in the paper by Allouche and Dekking, its sequence of first differences Delta = 1011010110..., given by Delta(n) = a(n+1)-a(n), is equal to y, where y = A005614 is the binary complement of the Fibonacci word. By definition, y is the fixed point of the morphism nu: 0->1, 1->10.",
        "The crucial observation is that a term occurs exactly once in (a(n)) if and only if the word 11 of length 2 occurs in Delta (with an exception for a(1)=1). So to obtain the sequence b of occurrences of these \"singleton terms\", we have to study the return words of 11 in y. (The return words of 11 in y are the words occurring in y that start with 11, and having no other occurrences of 11.)",
        "The return words of 11 are the words A:=11010, and B:=110. Since",
        "      nu(A) = nu(11010) = 10101101, nu(B) = nu(110) = 10101,",
        "the morphism nu induces a descendant morphism tau given by",
        "      tau(A) = BA, tau(B) = A.",
        "So tau is nothing else but the Fibonacci morphism on the alphabet {B,A}.",
        "Since the words A and B have lengths 5 and 3, the first differences b(n+1)-b(n) are given by the fixed point z = 5353353533... of the Fibonacci morphism on the alphabet {5,3}.",
        "From Lemma 8 in the paper by Allouche and Dekking we then obtain that the sequence b is a generalized Beatty sequence",
        "      V(n) = (5-3)floor(phi*n)+(2*3-5)*n+r = 2floor(phi*n)+n+r, for some integer r.",
        "Starting at the value 4, filling in n=1, we obtain that r=1, and so V(n) = 2floor(phi*n)+n+1. To incorporate also the first \"singleton term\" a(1)=1, we take",
