        "Except for a(1) = 1, these appear to be cubefree numbers with two distinct prime factors, or Heinz numbers of integer partitions with two distinct parts, none appearing more than twice. The enumeration of these partitions by sum is given by A307370. Equivalently, except for a(1) = 1, this sequence is the intersection of A004709 and A007774. - _Gus Wiseman_, Jul 03 2019"
