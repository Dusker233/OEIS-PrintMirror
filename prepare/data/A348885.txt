    "comment": [
        "This sequence stems from the property of the multinomial function that states that multinomial(p*a + r, p*b + s, p*c + t) = multinomial(a, b, c) * multinomial(r, s, t) mod p for all a >= 0, b >= 0, c >= 0, and r, s, t in the set {0, 1, ..., p-1}. a(n) is the number of such triples (r, s, t) for which this congruence also holds modulo p^2 for all a >= 0, b >= 0, and c >= 0, where p is the n-th prime.",
        "Equivalently, a(n) is the number of triples (r, s, t) of integers such that 0 <= r, s, t <= p-1 and either r + s + t >= 2*p or H(r) = H(s) = H(t) = H(r + s + t) mod p, where H(n) is the n-th harmonic number and p is the n-th prime. Note that the latter case here implies that r + s + t <= p-1, as otherwise the expression H(r + s + t) mod p would be undefined. This restriction shows why these two cases can never overlap.",
        "Geometrically, the set of triples (r, s, t) of integers such that 0 <= r, s, t <= p-1 and r + s + t >= 2*p creates a tetrahedron of points of height p - 2 (regardless of whether or not p is prime). It comes from the region in 3-space inside a cube and below a diagonal plane. As a result, the cardinality of this set must be equal to p * (p - 1) * (p - 2) / 6."
