        "Numbers corresponding to a(2) and a(3) are probable primes. 2770 is in the sequence so 2770^2770 + 3 is a probable prime; it is interesting that 277027703 is also prime. For the first term we have the same property: both 2^2 + 3 and 223 are prime.",
        "The prime corresponding to the next term, if it exists, has more than 20000 digits.",
