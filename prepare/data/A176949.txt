        "Composite numbers n which are not of form (k/2)*[(m-2)*k - (m-4)] for any m >= 3 and k >= 3, thus not m-gonal numbers for any order k >= 3.",
        "An m-gonal number, m >= 3, i.e., of the form n = (k/2)*[(m-2)*k - (m-4)], yields a nontrivial factorization of n if and only if k >= 3. (End)",
        "Since we are looking for solutions of (m-2)*k^2 - (m-4)*k - 2*n = 0,",

        "    m = [2n + 2*k*(k-2)]/[k*(k-1)] with order k = 3, thus m <= (n+3)/3.",
        "Composite numbers n which are divisible by 3 are m-gonal numbers of order 3, with m = (n + 3)/3. Thus all a(n) are coprime to 3.",

If all the congruence tests fail, a composite n belongs to this sequence. - _Daniel Forgues_, Aug 02 2016",

        "All numbers n>2 are trivially n-gonal numbers, and will thus have A176948(n)=n unless they have a nontrivial polygonal decomposition. Thus this is just the sequence of non-polygonal composite numbers.",
        "Note that the 2nd through 13th terms are in arithmetic progression.",
        "Some reasons: many of the smaller odd numbers are prime (and thus don't appear); numbers of the form 6x (or 6x+3) are always order-3 numbers; numbers of the form 6x+4 are always order-4 numbers; small odd composites not divisible by 3 are usually divisible by 5, and are thus order-5 numbers.",
        "In fact, the first number to break the arithmetic progression is the first product of distinct primes > 5.",
        "Conversely, 6x+2 numbers cannot be order-3 or -6 numbers (those are divisible by 3); order-4 numbers (2 is not a square (mod 6)); order-5 numbers (all odd); or order-7 numbers (all == 1 (mod 3)).",
