        "For a positive fundamental discriminant d, the class number of the real quadratic field of discriminant d is odd if and only if d = 8 or is of one of the three following forms: (i) p, where p is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4; (ii) 4p or 8p, where p is a prime congruent to 3 modulo 4; (iii) pq, where p, q are distinct primes congruent to 3 modulo 4. See Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 of Ezra Brown's link. A003656 gives the case where the class number is 1."
