    "comment": [
        "The terms in this sequence can be considered as a solution to the \"near miss\" problem which occurs frequently while solving Diophantine equations. It is known that if a number k can be written as the sum of two nonzero distinct squares then so can k^2 and k^2+1. Thus, finding numbers k such that k^2+2 satisfies the same property makes it quite interesting."
