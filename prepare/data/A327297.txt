        "Conjecture: if D is a term of this sequence, then D = uv, where u, v are 4, 8 or primes congruent to 3 modulo 4. For example, a(1) = 12 = 3*4, a(2) = 21 = 3*7, a(3) = 24 = 3*8, a(4) = 28 = 4*7, a(5) = 33 = 3*11, ...

        "Let k be the quadratic field with discriminant D, O_k be ring of integers of k, N(x) be the norm of x and (D/p) be the Kronecker symbol. If D is a term of this sequence and D = uv, where u, v are 4, 8 or primes congruent to 3 modulo 4, then:",

For example, for D = 21 and p = 37, we have ((-3)/37) = ((-7)/37) = 1, and N(x) = 37 has solution x = (13 + sqrt(21))/2, but N(y) = -37 has no solutions in Q(sqrt(21)).",

For example, for D = 12 and p = 11, we have ((-3)/11) = ((-4)/11) = -1, and N(x) = -11 has solution x = 1 + 2*sqrt(3), but N(y) = 11 has no solutions in Q(sqrt(3)).",

        "Also, it is conjectured that the quadratic field with discriminant D has form class number 2, where D is a term of this sequence. This is equivalent to the conjecture above. [This can also be deduced from the first paragraph of Ezra Brown link: the norm of the fundamental unit of the field k is -1 if D = 8 or a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4, and 1 if D is in this sequence.
