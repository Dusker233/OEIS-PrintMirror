        "Let G, the group of rotations in n-dimensional Euclidean space, act on the set of (2^n)! paintings of an n-orthoplex bound by 2^n cells of dimension n-1. There are (2^n)! fixed points in the action table since the only element in G that leaves a painting fixed is the identity element. The order of G is 2^(n-1)*n! = A002866(n). So by Burnside's Lemma a(n) = (2^n)!/|G|.",
