        "There are primes p for which there exist a positive integer k and another prime q such that p=q*(2k+1)-2k. See A136020, A091180, A136061 and the subsequent sequences.  Such k is called an \"order\" of the prime p. Note that q is necessarily larger than 2 and that 4*k is necessarily smaller than p-1. A prime may belong to more than one order, but the primes listed in the present sequence do not belong to any order.",
