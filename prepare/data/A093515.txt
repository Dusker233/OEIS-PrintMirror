        "Original name: Transform of the prime sequence by the Rule 110 cellular automaton.",
        "As described in A051006, a monotonic sequence can be mapped into a fractional real. Then the binary digits of that real can be treated (transformed) by an elementary cellular automaton. Taking the resulting sequence of binary digits as a fractional real, it can be mapped back into a sequence, as in A092855.",
        "From _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 01 2008: (Start)",
        "The \"Rule110\" transform as used here involves a right-shift of the sequence before applying the transform as described on the MathWorld page.",
        "_Robert G. Wilson v_ observed that this sequence contains exactly the indices for which A121561 equals 1. (End)",
        "From _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 07 2019: (Start)",
        "The correspondence of monotonic sequences with fractional reals mentioned in the first comment is not really relevant here: RuleX most naturally maps directly one characteristic sequence to another and thus one set (or increasing sequence) to another one. Interpreting the characteristic sequences as binary digits of a fractional real then yields a map from [0,1] into [0,1] rather as a consequence.",
        "_Antti Karttunen_ observed that this seems to be the complement of A005381 (k and k-1 are composite). This is indeed the case: The characteristic sequence of primes has no three subsequent 1's. In all other cases of the 8 possible inputs for Rule110, the output is 0 if and only if the cell itself and its neighbor to the right are zero, which here means \"k and k+1 are composite\", and with the right shift mentioned above, the complement of A005381, i.e., numbers such that k or k-1 is prime (or: primes U primes + 1). We have actually proved the more general",
