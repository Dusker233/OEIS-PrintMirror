        "The \"fragments\" are generated as follows. For each of the polycubes with n cells, counted by A000162(n) or b(n) = A038119(n), consider two possible ways to inscribe a tetrahedron into each cell so that the tetrahedra in any two neighboring cells share an edge. The centers of the cells correspond to cations in the antifluorite structure, while the vertices of the tetrahedra correspond to anions. a(n) is the number of resulting tetrahedral clusters; enantiomorphic pairs are counted as one. Thus b(n) <= a(n) <= 2*b(n). - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Mar 04 2023"
