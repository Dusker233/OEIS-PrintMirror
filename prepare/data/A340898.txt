    "comment": [
        "Start with a complete bipartite graph K(3,n) with vertex sets A and B where |A| = 3 and |B| is at least 4. We can arrange the points in sets A and B such that h(A,B) = d(a,b) for all a in A and b in B, where h is the Hausdorff metric. The pair [A,B] is a configuration. Then a set C is between A and B at location s if h(A,C) = h(C,B) = h(A,B) and h(A,C) = s. Call a pair ab, where a is in A and b is in B an edge. This sequence provides the number of sets between sets A' and B' at location s in a new configuration [A',B'] obtained from [A,B] by removing three edges, where all three removed edges are incident to the same point in A. So this sequence gives the number of sets at each location on the line segment between A' and B'.",
