        "Since gcd(phi(n),n) = 1, all terms are squarefree. Then, for n = p1 * ... * pk with primes p1 < ... < pk, (n+1)/phi(n) is very close to p1/(p1-1)*...*pk/(p1-1). Since p/(p-1) is decreasing as p grows, having (n+1)/phi(n) = 3 implies that p1 >= 5 and further that n >= 2.4*10^56 is a product of at least 33 primes. Similarly, having (n+1)/phi(n) >= 4 implies that n >= 1.6*10^30 is a product of at least 21 primes. Hence, the terms of this sequence below 1.6*10^30 have (n+1)/phi(n) = 2 and thus coincide with A050474. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jan 30 2022"
