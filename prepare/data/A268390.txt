        "The closure of A238748 with respect to the commutative binary operation A059897(.,.). As integers are self-inverse under A059897(.,.), the sequence thereby forms a subgroup, denoted H, of the positive integers under A059897(.,.). H is a subgroup of A000379.",
        "(The symbol ^ can take on a meaning in relation to a group operation. However, in this comment ^ denotes the power operator for standard integer multiplication.) For any prime p, the subgroup {p^k : k >= 0} and H are each a (left and right) transversal of the other. For k >= 0 and primes p_1 and p_2, the cosets (p_1^k)H and (p_2^k)H are the same.",

        "The terms are the elements of the ideal generated by {6} in the ring defined in A329329. Similarly, the ideal generated by {8} gives A262675. 6 and 8 are images of each other under A225546(.), which is an automorphism of the ring. So this sequence and A262675, as sets, are images of each other under A225546(.). The elements of the ideal generated by {6,8} form the notable set A000379.",
