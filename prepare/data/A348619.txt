    "comment": [
        "A 'gapset' is a finite subset G of IN, ordered in the natural order, satisfying the postulate: 'If z in G and z = x + y for some x, y in IN, then x or y is in G.' G is a 'gapset of genus n' means that G has n elements. G is a 'k-sparse gapset' if the distance between any consecutive elements of G is at most k. A 'pure k-sparse gapset' G is a k-sparse gapset such there exist consecutive elements l and l' in G which assume this upper bound, i.e., such that l' - l = k."
