        "The above empirical observation is true.",

        "Proof: Since the singleton set {x} has harmonic mean x, a(n) >= a(n-1)+1.",
        "Let S = {s_1,s_2,..,s_n} be a subset of {1,2,..,p^k} with n>1 elements such that s_n = p^k and let H be the harmonic mean of S. Let M = A003418(p^k) be the least common multiple of {1,2,..,p^k}. Then M = Wp^k where p does not divide W = A002944(p^k).",
        "Let Q_i = M/s_i and Q = sum_i Q_i. This implies that Q_n = W and p divides Q_i for i < n.",
        "H can be written as nM/Q. Since p does not divide W, this implies that p does not divide Q. Suppose H is an integer. Then this implies that Q divides nM/p^k = nW.",
        "Note that s_i < s_n for i < n. This implies that Q_i > W for i < n, i.e. Q > nW, and this contradicts the fact that Q divides nW and thus H is not an integer.",
        "Thus {p^k} is the only subset of {1,2,..,p^k} that includes p^k and have an integral Harmonic mean.",
        "This concludes the proof.",
