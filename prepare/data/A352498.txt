    "comment": [
        "The Koch chain K_s is a sequence of 2^s+1 points which form an x-monotone chain of unavoidable edges in the plane with the same combinatorial structure as the fractal Koch curve.",
        "Given that the number of points already grows exponentially in s, the numbers of triangulations themselves have double exponential growth of roughly 9.083^(2^s), see Theorem 5 of Rutschmann, Wettstein (2022)."
