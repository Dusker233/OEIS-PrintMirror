    "comment": [
        "This is a fairly optimal sequence for reverse-sorting an ascending list where N = 128. Requires 4.875*N comparisons. 4.875 is approximately equal to 2.31*log_10(128). The operation performed requires a defined, substantial and certainly nontrivial amount of work which is repeatable for a list of any size."
