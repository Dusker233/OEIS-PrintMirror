        "These numbers come mostly in chunks/runs of length 2 or 36 or 23 (first occurring as length of the 7th run starting with 706) or later 14 (length of a run starting at 6768), 1081 (length of a run starting with 15303), 20 (length of a run starting with 21186), ...",

        "This set exhibits an interesting self-similar, pseudo-symmetric structure. This is due to the following",
        "Proposition: Let d(n) = (3^r(n)-1)/2 + (4^s(n)-1)/3, where r and s are exponents such that 4^(s(n)-1) <= 3^(r(n)-1) < 3^r(n) < 4^s(n), r(0) = s(0) = 1 being the only case with equality. Then any x <= d(n) is in this sequence iff d(n) - x is in the sequence.",
        "The study of this set is certainly useful in view of a proof of Erd\u00f6s' conjecture mentioned in A327621, namely, the positive density of A005836 + A000695 (set-wise sum). This is obviously equivalent to an asymptotic density strictly smaller than 1 of the present sequence which is the complement."
