        "The sequence is infinite. Any number which is formed by concatenating two-digit multiples of 11 is a term.",
        "To determine whether a given number k is a term of this sequence, start with k, take the cube of each digit of k, sum them together with alternating signs and take the absolute value of the result, apply the same process to the result, and continue until 0 is reached or a loop is entered. If 0 is reached, k is a term of this sequence. If not, k is not a term of this sequence."
