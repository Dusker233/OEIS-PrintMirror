        "The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k), so these are Heinz numbers of integer partitions whose multiplicities, starting from the largest part through to the smallest, form an initial interval of positive integers. The enumeration of these partitions by sum is given by A179269."
