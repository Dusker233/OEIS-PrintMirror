        "Numbers n such that A191255(n) = 0 or 3. Previous definition was numbers n such that A191255(2*n) = 1, that is, numbers of the form 2^(3t)*s where s is an odd number.",
        "{+-a(n)} gives all nonzero cubes modulo all powers of 2, that is, nonzero cubes over the 2-adic integers. So this sequence is closed under multiplication. (End)",
        "The old entry had the conjecture that a(n) = A067368(n)/2. _Jianing Song_, Sep 21 2018 showed that this is true, and gave us the simpler definition that we have now used. The conjecture is correct because {a(n)} lists the numbers of the form 2^(3t)*s, and {A067368(n)} lists the numbers of the form 2^(3t+1)*s, where s is an odd number. Note also that a(n) = A213258(n)/4."
