        "The result of the \"slide\" operation does not need to be in the initial position, e.g., the number 1 reproduces itself displaced by 1 position.",
        "The first terms which can be \"slided\" into themselves without changing place are 0, 11, 110, 202, 1100, 1111, 2020, 2222, 3003, 3113, 11000, 11011, 11110, 11202, 20200, 20211, ...",

However, even though they are not concatenation of smaller terms, 2222, 3113 and all the 5-digit terms except 40004 are a \"non-interfering superposition\" of earlier terms, i.e., the nonzero digits take the place of zero digits of earlier terms.",

        "Actually, most of the terms are of that form: among the 131 terms < 10^6, there are 45 repdigits, 80 fixed-position self-slideable numbers of the above form, and only 6 other terms, { 12222, 22221, 31313, 122221, 131313, 313131 }."
