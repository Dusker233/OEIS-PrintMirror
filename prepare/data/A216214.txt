        "A string x of length n is (weakly) quasiperiodic if there is a string w of length < n for which copies can be placed (possibly overlapping; possibly hanging off the left and right ends of x) that completely cover x.  For example, x = 001101 is weakly quasiperiodic with quasiperiod w = 0110; three copies of w suffice to cover x.  A string is (strongly) superprimitive if it is not weakly quasiperiodic."
