        "A graph with m vertices is called increasing, or topolicically ordered, if each vertex v is assigned a number l(v) from {1,...,m} and if there is a directed path from vertex v to vertex w then l(v) < l(w).",
        "Note that a planar st-graph is an actual embedding into the plane, i.e., we distinguish a left-to-right order on the children of each node. In other words, it is a plane graph, a concept also sometimes called isotopy. (End)"
