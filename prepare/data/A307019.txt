        "1) Why do all these terms end with an even number of zeros?",
        "1.1) Is it possible to find a term that does not end with zeros? If such a term m exists, this number must satisfy the Diophantine equation m^2 = a*rev(a) = b*rev(b) = c*rev(c). No solution (m,a,b,c) with m that does not end with zeros is known.",
        "1.2) Consider now the Diophantine equation: m^2 = a*rev(a) = b*rev(b) where a is a palindrome and b is not a palindrome. For each solution (m,a,b), we generate terms (10*m)^2 of this sequence and we get: (10*m)^2 = 100 * m^2 = (100*a)*(rev(100*a) = (100*b)*(rev(100*b)) = (100*rev(b)) * (rev(100*rev(b))).",
        "Example: with a(1) = 63504 = 252^2 = 252 * 252 = 144 * 441, so (m,a,b) = (63504,252,144), we obtain the 3 following ways: 6350400 = 25200 * 252 = 14400 * 441 = 44100 * 144.",
        "2) When can square numbers be expressed in this way in more than three different ways?",
        "If the Diophantine equation: m^2 = a*rev(a) = b*rev(b), with a <> b and a and b not palindromes has a solution, then it is possible to get integers equal to (10*m)^2 which can be expressed as the product of a number and its reversal in exactly four different ways.",
        "We don't know if such a solution (m,a,b) exists.",
