    "comment": [
        "The terms can also be interpreted as numbers k such that a walk on the square lattice governed by the quaternary digits of Pi is at the origin after k steps, where digit 0 corresponds to a step to the right, 1 to up, 2 to left, and 3 to down.",
        "There are no more terms below 2*10^9.",
        "There are two variations of this sequence, according to the directions each digit corresponds to. In A339450, 0=right, 1=left, 2=up, 3=down. For the case 0=right, 1=up, 2=down, 3=left, the only terms below 2*10^9 are 0, 2, 4, 8."

    "example": [
        "4 is a term because the first four quaternary digits of Pi are 3, 0, 2, 1, one of each digit.",
        "386 is a term because among the first 386 digits there are 99 0's and 99 2's, and 94 1's and 94 3's."
