        "The counting function pi(x;q,(a,b)) is defined by Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan to be the number of primes p_n <= x such that p_n == a (mod q) and p_(n+1) == b (mod q).",
        "Note that it is known that assertions like pi(x;3,1) < pi(x;3,2) or pi(x;4,1) < pi(x;4,3) (\"Chebychev's biases\") are false infinitely often.",
        "Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan conjectured that pi(x;3,(1,1)) < pi(x,3,(1,2)) and pi(x;4,(1,1)) < pi(x;4,(1,3)) are robust biases, i.e., they always hold.",
        "Here we conjecture that pi(x;10,(9,1)) > pi(x;10,(1,7)) is a semi- robust bias, i.e., it holds from a certain value x_0 on. Here x_0 is conjectured to be 17839. This conjecture seems to be confirmed by the observation that pi(x;10,(9,1)) - pi(x;10,(1,7)) ~ (Li(x)/16) * (1/2) * log(2*Pi/5*log(x)) / log(x).",
