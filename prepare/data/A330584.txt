    "comment": [
        "Note: not every sublattice of the Leech lattice is necessarily a section of the Leech lattice. For example, every Niemeyer lattice is commensurable with the Leech lattice; thus the orders of the simple components of their automorphism groups are in this list, even when those groups are not sections of Co0.",
        "By a theorem of Conway and Sloane, any simple group with a cover that has a crystallographic representation in <= 21 dimensions is in this list.",
        "This is a subsequence of A330583."
