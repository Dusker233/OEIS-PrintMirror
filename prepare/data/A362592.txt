    "comment": [
        "It is known that fundamental and all higher roots of the corresponding positive Pell equation for these D values also produce abc-triples.",
        "These abc-triples are rare situations for triples of additively related pairwise relatively prime positive integers a + b = c, when radical R(abc) < c. Generally R(abc) > c; see Wikipedia."
