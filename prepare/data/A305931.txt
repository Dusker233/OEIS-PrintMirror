        "The complement A238939 is conjectured to have only 23 elements, the largest being 3^68. Thus, all larger powers of 3 are (conjectured to be) in this sequence. Each of the subsequences \"powers of 3 with exactly n digits 0\" is conjectured to be finite. Provided there is at least one such element for each n >= 0, this leads to a partition of the integers, given in A305933."
