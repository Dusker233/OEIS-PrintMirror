        "The fact that a(n) is an integer follows from the formula for the generating function. It is not difficult to show that f(x) := (hypergeom([1/2, 1/2], [1], 16*x) - 1)/4 is an element of Z[[x]]. Substituting x -> x/(1 + 3*x)^2 then shows that the given g.f. is in Z[[x]] as well. The fact that this formula is indeed the g.f. follows from the recurrence.",
        "One can also show that a(n) is odd, as follows. Reducing f(x) in Z[[x]] modulo 2 gives: x + x^2 + x^4 + x^8 + x^16 + ... Again substitute x -> x/(1 + 3*x)^2, which modulo 2 is: x + x^3 + x^5 + x^7 + ... Then use the fact that (a+b)^(2^i) is congruent to a^(2^i) + b^(2^i) modulo 2 to see that f(x/(1 + 3*x)^2) is congruent to x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + ... modulo 2, so every a(n) is congruent to 1 modulo 2.",
        "The formula a(n) = (A002426(n)^2 + 3*A002426(n-1)^2)/4 gives a second proof that a(n) is an odd integer. The numbers A002426(n) are odd, and so their squares are congruent to 1 modulo 8. Hence A002426(n)^2 + 3*A002426(n-1)^2 is congruent to 1 + 3 * 1 modulo 8. Since a(n) is that number divided by 4, it follows that a(n) is an odd integer. (End)"
