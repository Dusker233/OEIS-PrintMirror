        "n -> a(n+1) is a left inverse for A152917 and also, just like n -> a(n)+1, a left inverse to A000169(n) = n^(n-1), with codomain = the positive integers.",
        "a(n+1) is also the smallest m such that n can be written with at most m digits in base m+1. For example, the largest number that can be written with 2 digits in base 3 is 8 = 22[3], to write 9 we need to switch to a(9+1) = 3 digits in base 4. Similarly, 63 is the largest number that can be written with a(63+1) = 3 digits in base 4, and from 64 on we need to go to a(64+1) = 4 digits in base 5.",
