        "a(n) is the number of fixed Tangles (smooth simple closed curves piecewise-defined by quadrants of circles) which have a dual graph containing n edges, or equivalently, enclose an area of (4*n + Pi)*r^2, where 1/r is the curvature.  By 'fixed', we mean that we do not allow rotations or reflections.",
