    "comment": [
        "This sequence is used in a conjecture on points z_k of the discrete (outer) Theodorus spiral living on quadrant IV of the complex plane of sheet S_n, where S_n := {r*exp(i*phi), r > 0, 2*Pi*(n-1) <= phi < 2*Pi*n}. This corresponds to the n-th revolution, for n >= 1.",
        "This conjecture is  2*Pi - varphi(A072895(n)) > arctan(a(n)), n >= 1, with varphi(k) = phi(k) - 2*Pi*floor(phi(k)/(2*Pi)) where z_k = sqrt(k)*exp(i*phi(k)).",
        "This conjecture implies a conjecture relating points of the discrete inner spiral to those of the outer ones, namely Khat(k-2) := floor(phihat(k-2)/(2*Pi)) =  K(k) =: floor(phi(k)/(2*Pi)) for k >= 3, where zhat_k = sqrt(k)*exp(i*phihat(k)) is a point of the discrete inner Theodorus spiral, given in terms of z_k by zhat(k) = ((k-1 + 2*sqrt(k)*i )/(k+1))*z_k. This implies phihat(k) = phi(k) + arctan((sqrt(k-1) - sqrt(k-2))/(1 + sqrt((k-1)*(k-2)))). The implied conjecture Khat(k-2) = K(k), k >= 3, for the other three quadrants of each sheet S_n can be proved. For the inner spiral see the Waldvogel link.",
        "If the implied conjecture is true then A295339(n) = A072895(n) - 2, for n >= 1, hence A296179(n) = A295338(n), for n >= 2.",
