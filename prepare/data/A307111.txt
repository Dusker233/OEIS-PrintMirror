        "A primitive n-abundant number k is a number with sigma(k)/k > n and sigma(d)/d < n for all the proper divisors d of k.",
        "Cohen proved that for any given eps > 0 there are only finitely many primitive n-abundant numbers k with sigma(k)/k >= n + eps. Thus for each n there is a maximal value of the abundancy index sigma(k)/k for primitive n-abundant numbers k. If this maximum occurs at more than one number the least of them is given in this sequence."
