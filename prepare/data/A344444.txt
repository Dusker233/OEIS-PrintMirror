        "The only infinite monotonic completely additive integer sequence is the all 0's sequence (cf. A000004). The challenge taken up here is to specify one that is monotonic for a modestly long number of terms, using a comparatively short prescriptive definition.",
        "To start we specify values for a(2) and a(3) so that a(3)/a(2) approximates log(3)/log(2). 19/12 is a good approximation relative to the size of denominator. This reflects 2^19 = 524288 having a similar magnitude to 3^12 = 531441. Equivalently, we can say 3 is approximately the 19th power of the 12th root of 2. This approximation is used to construct musical scales. (See the Enevoldsen link, also A143800.) There is no better approximation with a denominator smaller than 29. [Revised by _Peter Munn_, Jun 14 2022]",
        "To find a good specification to use for a(p) for larger primes, p, we are guided by knowing that if 2*a(n) < a(n-1) + a(n+1) then a completely additive sequence is not monotonic after a(n^2-1) because a(n^2) < a((n-1)*(n+1)) = a(n^2-1). Considering n = p, we see we want a(p) >= (a(p-1) + a(p+1))/2; but the same consideration for n = p-1 shows we don't want a(p) larger than necessary. These considerations lead towards the choice of \"a(p) = ceiling((a(p-1) + a(p+1))/2)\" for use in the definition."
