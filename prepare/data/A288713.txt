        "The sequence (a(n)) consists of the positions of 1 in A288711, which can be obtained from A289034 by a [0->00, 1->10]-transform (see Kimberling's observation in the Comments of A288707). Similarly, the sequence A288709 consists of the positions of 1 in A288707, which can be obtained from A189661 by the same [0->00, 1->10]-transform. It is shown in the Comments of A189661 that A189661 = A289034, except for the first two terms. In A189661 these two terms are 0,1, which is transformed to 0,0,1,0. In A289034 these two terms are 1,0, which is transformed to 1,0,0,0. We see that the first 1 in A288711 occurs at position 1, but the first 1 in A288707 appears at position 3. The next 1's will occur at the same position in the two sequences.",
