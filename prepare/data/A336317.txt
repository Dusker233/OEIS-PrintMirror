        "Also, all terms after 1 seem to be even, which would imply that apart from its initial 1, A001599 were a subsequence of A102750. However, this is false, as there are terms of A001599 not in A102750, for example 8011798098793361832960 found by _David A. Corneth_. Note that A122111(8011798098793361832960) = 96922193555635754403846044921625, which is thus an odd term of this sequence."
