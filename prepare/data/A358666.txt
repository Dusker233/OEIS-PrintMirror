        "All numbers in this sequence are divisible by 12. Proof: Suppose n is odd and in this sequence, then either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 4, creating a contradiction. Suppose n is even, but not divisible by 4, then n-2 is divisible by 4, creating a contradiction. Suppose n is not divisible by 3. Then there exist x such that 3x and 3(x+1) are among squarefree semiprimes surrounding n; one of them is divisible by 6, creating a contradiction."
