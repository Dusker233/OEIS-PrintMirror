        "For any nonnegative number n, the EQ-triangle for n is built by taking as first row the binary expansion of n (without leading zeros), having each entry in the subsequent rows be the EQ of the two values above it (a \"1\" indicates that these two values are equal, a \"0\" indicates that these values are different).",

        "This sequence is a variant of A334556; here we use bitwise EQ, there bitwise XOR."
