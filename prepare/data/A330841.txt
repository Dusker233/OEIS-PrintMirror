        "a(1) = 3528 has power-spectral basis {21^2, 28^2, 48^2}, of index 1. If n > 1, then a(n) has power-spectral basis {M^2*(M+2)^2, (1/4)*M^2*(M+1)^2, (M^2-1)^2}, with index 2, where M=A000668(n+1) is the (n+1)-st Mersenne prime. The first element of the spectral basis of a(n), n > 1, is A330819(n+1), the second element is A133051(n+1), and the third element is A330820(n+1). Generally, a power-spectral basis is a spectral basis that consists of primes and powers.",
        "The spectral sum of a(n), that is, the sum of the elements of its spectral basis, is a(1) + 1 whenever n = 1, and 2*a(n)+1 whenever n > 1. In this case, we say that a(n) has index 1 and index 2, respectively.",
        "a(n), n > 1, is also isospectral with 9*A133051(n), that is, a(n) and 9*A133051(n) have the same spectral basis, but 9*A133051(n) has index 1. Thus 9*A133051(n) and a(n) form an isospectral pair."
