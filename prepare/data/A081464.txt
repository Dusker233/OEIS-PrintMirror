        "The numbers have an interpretation in terms of music theory - these numbers characterize integer harmonics that offer monotonically closer approximations to the stacks of just-intonated perfect fifths (3/2). Repeated stacking of this interval forms the basis of the Pythagorean tuning. For example, a(3) = 4; 1.5^4 = 5.0625, therefore the 5th harmonic is close to a stack of 4 perfect fifths. This specific difference is known as the syntonic comma.",
        "Likewise, 1.5^29 = 127834.039..., therefore the 127834th harmonic is close to a stack of 29 perfect fifths, but in real life this example is wider than the human hearing range (20 Hz to 20 kHz, 1000 times), therefore lacks practical application. (End)"
