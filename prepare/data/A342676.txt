        "D. Applegate, M. LeBrun and N. J. A. Sloane conjectured that the number of base b lunar primes with k digits approaches (b-1)^2*b^(k-2) as k tends to infinity. And necessary conditions for a number n to be prime are that it contain b-1 as a digit and (if k > 2) does not end with 0 (see Links). Since the number of base b integers with k digits equals b^k - b^(k-1), the lunar prime density among integers with k digits should be (b-1)^2*b^(k-2)/(b^k - b^(k-1)), which is 1 - 1/b as k -> oo, if the conjecture holds. Note that, as b increases, the limit approaches 1, or lim{b->oo} lim(n->oo} a(n)/n = 1. As n tends to infinity, the probability of finding a base b number having a digit of b-1 approaches 100%, and the probability of finding a base b number ending with 0 approaches 1/b. Therefore, essentially all numbers except those ending with 0 are lunar primes as n tends to infinity.",
