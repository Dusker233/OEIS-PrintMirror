        "As this problem is symmetric with sign we can get the same numbers for strictly positive real parts.",
        "All values for n > 1 are even, because a transposed matrix has the same spectrum of eigenvalues.",
        "Matrices with determinant 0 are not counted.",
        "Let M be such a matrix then the limit of ||exp(t*M)*y|| if t goes to infinity will be zero.",
        "n = 5 is the first case where not all entries on the main diagonal are -1. 93984 matrices with 5 times -1 on the main diagonal and 5*768 with 4 times -1 on the main diagonal have only eigenvalues with strictly negative real part.",
        "In the case n = 6, 43586048 matrices with 6 times -1 on the main diagonal, 6*656000 matrices with 5 times -1 on the main diagonal and 15*1536  matrices with 5 times -1 on the main diagonal have only eigenvalues with strictly negative real part."
