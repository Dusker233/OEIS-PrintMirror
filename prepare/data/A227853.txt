        "The given expression seems to produce safe primes quite frequently. The numbers 6*(4620*a(n)-1) form a subsequence of A230032.",

        "This is common because 4620 = 12*5*7*11 contains several small prime factors, which reduces the possible 12x-1 remainders, forcing all safe primes to be in other 12x-1 remainders mod 4620. Something similar would happen if 4620 were replaced with 12*5*7*13 = 5460. - _Mark Andreas_, Dec 31 2021"
