        "With this [*] definition of the length of a change-ringing sequence; for 6 bells we get a maximum length of factorial(6)=720, thus we have 720 possible lengths, namely 1,2,...,720. Hence {a(n)} has 720 terms. For m bells, where m is a natural number larger than zero, we get a maximum length of factorial(m). When denoting the number of cyclic change-ringing sequences of length n for m bells as a_m(n), {a_m(n)} has factorial(m) terms for all m."
