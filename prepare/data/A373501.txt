    "comment": [
        "a(A246655(n)) is the size of the collineation group of the projective plane of order q=p^k. It is also known as the projective semilinear group, PGammaL(3,q), the semidirect product of PGL(3,q) (whose order is probably given by A003800) with the group of field automorphisms of F(q). The latter is the cyclic group of order k. Therefore, |PGammaL(3,p^k)|=|PGL(3,p^k)|*k."

However, exactly 168 of these permutations lead to the same set of subsets. One such permutation is the full cycle (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) whose action can bee seen in the second column. It also permutes the lines cyclically by mapping line i to line i+1 (mod v). Another one is the cycle product (0 6)(3 5) in the third column. It swaps lines 1 and 6 and lines 4 and 5 and leaves the other three lines fixed."
