    "comment": [
        "Jacques Tramu confirmed and extended these results. If all of the unnecessary primes are excluded, all even numbers up to 60000 can be obtained. Not proved, a proof of Goldbach's conjecture would be easier. It would be good to verify the unnecessary list to a million or so. So far, 3/5 of the primes are unnecessary."

    "example": [
        "3 and 5 are necessary for 3+5=8. 7 is necessary for 5+7 = 12. 11 seems to be a completely unnecessary prime, so I marked it as such. 13 is then needed for 5+13 = 18 (can't use 7+11=18, since I've ruled 11 unnecessary). And so on, looking at each prime in turn and determining whether they are necessary or unnecessary."
