        "For definition of quantale see A354493.",
        "A quantale is left-sided if every element x satisfies T * x <= x, and right-sided if every element x satisfies x * T <= x. Here T denotes the top element of the underlying lattice.",
        "Transposition of the semigroup table yields a bijection between left-sided and right-sided quantales, so this sequence counts either type."
