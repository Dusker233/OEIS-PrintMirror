Clearly, the first sequence does not contain any multiples of 5, while all the terms in the second one are multiples of 25, and thus of 5 also.",
        "Then consider sequences 1 + 2*(1 + 11*2^k): 47, 91, 179, 355, 707, 1411, etc., and A163511(1 + 2*(1 + 11*2^k)): 121, 605, 3025, 15125, 75625, 378125, etc. The terms in the first one are never multiples of 11, while the terms of second one are all multiples of 121, thus of 11 also.",
        "Consider also sequences 1 + (2^k)*(1+2*11): 47, 93, 185, 369, 737, 1473, 2945, 5889, 11777, 23553, 47105, 94209, 188417, 376833, 753665, 1507329,  etc, and 1 + (2^k)*(1+4*11): 91, 181, 361, 721, 1441, 2881, 5761, 11521, 23041, 46081, 92161, 184321, 368641, 737281, 1474561, 2949121, etc. The only time their terms are multiples of 11 is when k = 5, 15, 25, ..., 5 + 10*j, j>= 0, while for sequences A163511(1 + (2^k)*(1+2*11)): 121, 363, 1089, 3267, 9801, 29403, etc, and A163511(1 + (2^k)*(1+4*11)): 605, 1815, 5445, 16335, 49005, 147015, etc, all the terms are multiples of 121, thus of 11 also.",
        "There are numerous other such correspondences that forbid the occurrence of factor x in n, when n is a member of a certain subset of odd numbers, while on the other hand, force the same factor x to be present in A163511(n), thus making it impossible that n were a multiple of A163511(n) in those cases. However, this sequence shows that such subsets do not completely cover all odd numbers. Similar observation applies to Doudna sequence (see A364547)."
