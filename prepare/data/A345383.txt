        "The rules of Super Six for two players are simple. Game equipment consists of a six-sided die, a number of sticks, and a box whose lid has six holes. The holes numbered 1 through 5 are shallow, and a stick placed in any one of them will stand up in it; hole #6 goes all the way through the lid so that any stick placed in it falls into the box and is out of play. Initially, an even number of sticks are divided evenly between the two players. The goal is to get rid of all one's sticks before the other player does.",
        "The players take turns. On each turn, the player whose turn it is rolls the die and places a stick in the numbered hole that matches the number on the die (e.g., a player who rolls a 4 then places a stick in hole #4). The player may roll and place a stick for each roll as many times as desired until rolling a number that is already filled by a stick. When this occurs, the player must take that stick in hand, and play passes to the opposing player.",
        "The game proceeds with players taking turns and ends when one player has run out of sticks. The only freedom that the players have is the decision whether to continue rolling the die or not after successfully placing a stick.",
        "If there are 3 sticks left in the game (i.e., held by a player or standing on the lid), there is just one situation in which a player may have to make a decision to stop or to continue: each player has 1 stick, and 1 stick is on the lid; obviously the best strategy is to continue because the probability to win is 5 out of 6. Hence the optimum strategy is \"1\", where the \"1\" stands for keep rolling the die.",
        "If there are 4 sticks left in the game, there are three situations in which a player may have to make a decision to stop or to continue: in the first, each player has 1 stick, and 2 sticks are on the lid (situation 1); in the second, the player whose turn it is has two sticks, the opposing player has 1 stick, and 1 stick is on the lid (situation 2); in the third, the player whose turn it is has one stick, the opposing player has 2 sticks, and 1 stick is on the lid (situation 3). So there are eight strategies, which may be coded in binary as 000, 001, 010, ... 111, where the digits specify whether the player will continue (1) or stop (0).",
        "The sequence of the situations is defined by 1) the number of sticks on the lid and 2) the number of sticks held by player A (both sorted in descending order). For 5 sticks, this means the sequence is given by 3/1, 2/2, 2/1, 1/3, 1/2, 1/1 where L/H means there are L sticks on the lid and player A is holding H sticks (necessarily, player B has 5-L-H sticks). Strategy \"100\" means to stop at situation 1 and 2 and to continue at situation 3.",
        "In the paper \"Optimum Strategies for the Game Super Six\" (see link below) the situations with 1 stick on the lid, H sticks in the hand of player A and 1 stick in the hand of player B are not considered as situations where a strategy may be required, because these situations can only occur if a player stops rolling the die when there are zero sticks on the lid. This is mathematically not a logical event, but of course it is a possible situation. - _Ruediger Jehn_, Oct 05 2021"

        "a(4) = 7. With 4 sticks left in the game, there are three situations in which a player has a choice and in all situations the best strategy is to keep rolling the die. Hence the best strategy is \"111\", which, when converted to a decimal number, gives 7."
