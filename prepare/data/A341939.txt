        "The first 11 terms of this sequence are also the first 11 terms of A341938: m such that phi(m)*tau(m) is a square, then, a(12) = 57 while A341938(12) = 54. Indeed, if phi(m)/tau(m) is a perfect square then phi(m)*tau(m) is also a square, but the converse is false. These counterexamples are in A341940, the first one is 54 (last example).",
