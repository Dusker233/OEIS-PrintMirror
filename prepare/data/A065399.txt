        "Such a number will always have the maximum allowable digit in all places that are larger in base n than in factorial base. The remaining digits can be checked sequentially, since the difference between place values in factorial base and base n increase by more than a factor of n at that point. - _Charlie Neder_, Jun 12 2019"
