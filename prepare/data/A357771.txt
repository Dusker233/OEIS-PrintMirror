    "name": "Number of 2n-step closed paths on quasi-regular rhombic (rhombille) lattice starting from a degree-6 node.",
    "comment": [
        "Paths that return to the same point in a quasi-regular rhombic lattice must always have even length (i.e., 2n) because of parity: degree-6 nodes alternate with degree-3 nodes."
    ],
    "example": [
        "a(2)=60, because there are 6*6=36 paths that visit one of six adjacent vertices, return to the origin, and again visit an adjacent vertex and return to the origin; plus 6*4=24 paths that pass through one of the six vertices at distance 2, leaving and returning via any of two available paths to that vertex; all resulting in a closed path of length 2n=2*2=4."
