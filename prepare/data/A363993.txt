    "comment": [
        "In general, if r > 0 and n > 1, then a(n) is the number k such that h(k) <= r + h(n-1) < h(k+1), where h(m) = m-th harmonic number. Since h(n) is approximately g + log(n+1/2), where g = Euler-Mascheroni constant (A001620), it is easy to prove that a(n) or a(n)-1 is the number floor[n*e^r-(1+e^r)/2]. Thus, the difference sequence of (a(n)) has at most two distinct numbers. For r = 2, the two numbers are 7 and 8."
