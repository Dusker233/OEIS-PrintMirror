    "comment": [
        "Dence and Dence noted that the values of phi(k) congruent to 2 (mod 12) are sparse compared to the other possible even values. For example, for k <= 10^4 there only 10 values of phi(k) congruent to 2 (mod 12), compared to 6114, 1650, 511, 1233, and 476 values congruent to 0, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (mod 12), respectively. They proved that the asymptotic density of this sequence is 0 by showing that the only terms above 6 are of the form p^e and 2*p^e with p == 11 (mod 12) a prime and e even.",
        "Dence and Pomerance showed that the asymptotic number of the terms below x is ~ (1/2 + 1/(2*sqrt(2)))*sqrt(x)/log(x)."
