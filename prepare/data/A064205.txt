        "Theorem: Terms that are greater than one must be twice a square.",
        "Proof: Since sigma(k) is odd if and only if k is a square or twice a square, and tau(k) is odd if and only if k is a square, then an odd sum only occurs when k is twice a square, in which case sigma(k) is odd and tau(k) is even. So, these are the only candidates for sigma(k) + tau(k) being prime.",
        "Theorem: No terms are congruent to 4 or 6 (mod 10).",
        "Proof: Since no square ends in 2, 3, 7, or 8, and each term > 1 is twice a square, no term ends in 4 or 6. (End)"
