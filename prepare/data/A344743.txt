        "The reverse-alternating sum of a partition (y_1,...,y_k) is Sum_i (-1)^(k-i) y_i. This is equal to (-1)^(m-1) times the number of odd parts in the conjugate partition, where m is the number of parts. So a(n) is the number of even-length partitions of 2n with at least one odd conjugate part. By conjugation, this is also the number of partitions of 2n with greatest part even and at least one odd part.",
