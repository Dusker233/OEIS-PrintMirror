Proof: If m is in the sequence then phi(m) and m are palindromes since phi(m) is a palindrome so 10=phi(11) doesn't divide phi(m) hence 11 doesn't divide m but we know that 11 divides every palindromic number with an even number of digits so m can't have an even number of digits. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Feb 03 2006"
