        "For n = 4, when we examine row 13 in A088643, the Roche algorithm produces the initial row values 13, 10, 9, 8, 11, 12. The remaining values are equal to row 7 in A088643, and at no earlier point in row 13 are the remaining values equal to row m, 7 < m < 13. So we calculate the difference between 13 and 7 (\"the uncharted length\") to be 6, which is longer than the previous record uncharted length (A049478(3) = 4) set by row a(3) = 5. So a(4) = 13. - _Peter Munn_, Aug 03 2021 (based on text supplied by _J. Stauduhar_)"
