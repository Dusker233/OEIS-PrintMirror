    "comment": [
        "The number of the square ring around the origin the walk is currently on is just the maximum of the absolute values of its current x and y coordinates. In this sequence the SAW cannot step to a coordinate that has a smaller ring number than the ring it is currently on. For example, a step from (1,2) to either (2,2), (1,3), (0,2) is permitted as it stays on the second ring or steps to the third, but a step from (1,2) to (1,1) is forbidden as that would be stepping to the smaller first ring."

    "example": [
        "a(0..3) are the same as the standard square lattice SAW of A001411 as the walk cannot step to a smaller ring in the first three steps.",
        "a(4) = 92. If we restrict the first one or more steps to the right followed by an upward step then there is one walk which steps to a smaller ring and is thus forbidden. That is the walk (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1). As this can be walked in eight different ways on the square lattice the number of 4-step walks becomes A001411(4) - 8 = 100 - 8 = 92."
