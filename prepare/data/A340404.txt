    "name": "Number of sets in the geometry determined by the Hausdorff metric at each location between two sets defined by a complete bipartite graph K(5,n) (with n at least 4) missing three edges, where the removed edges are incident to different vertices in the 5-point set and none of the removed edges are incident to the same vertex in the other set.",
    "comment": [
        "Start with a complete bipartite graph K(5,n) with vertex sets A and B where |A| = 5 and |B| is at least 4. We can arrange the points in sets A and B such that h(A,B) = d(a,b) for all a in A and b in B, where h is the Hausdorff metric. The pair [A,B] is a configuration. Then a set C is between A and B at location s if h(A,C) = h(C,B) = h(A,B) and h(A,C) = s. Call a pair ab, where a is in A and b is in B an edge. This sequence provides the number of sets between sets A' and B' at location s in a new configuration [A',B'] obtained from [A,B] by removing three edges, where the removed edges are incident to different points in A and none of the removed edges are incident to the same point in B. So this sequence tells the number of sets at each location on the line segment between A' and B'.",
