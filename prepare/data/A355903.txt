    "comment": [
        "To find a(n), start by placing n stones labeled 1 on an infinite chessboard.",
        "Set k=2. At step k, you must place a stone labeled k in a square where the sum of its neighbors is x*k for some x >= 1. That is, the sum of the neighbors must be an integral multiple of k.",
        "If there is no way to do that, this game ends, and you win k-1 dollars. If you can do it, you increment k and repeat.",
        "Then a(n) = maximum number of dollars you can win with optimal play for any initial placement of the n starting stones.",
        "The sequence was proposed by _Skylark Xentha Murphy-Davies_ on Sep 16 2022. She found lower bounds for a(2), a(3), and a(4). On Sep 17 2022, _Hugo van der Sanden_ showed that her lower bound for a(2) was the correct value, and found the values of a(3) and a(4).",
        "In the original version of the problem (see A337663) each stone that you place must equal the sum of its 8 neighbors."
