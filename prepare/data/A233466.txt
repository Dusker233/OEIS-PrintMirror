        "According to the following theorem I discovered recently, the 20-digit number 18446744047939747845 is in the sequence.",
        "Theorem: If k and m are integers, k < 6, and p = 2^2^k + m is a prime such that p does not divide 2^2^k-1, then p*(2^2^k-1) is a solution to the equation phi(x) = (x+m)/2.",
        "Note that m cannot be -1 and for k < 6, 2^2^k-1 is the product of the first k Fermat primes.",
        "Take m=-5; since 2^2^2-5, 2^2^3-5 and 2^2^5-5 are prime we get three terms of the sequence.",
