        "A Boolean function is unate in a variable if it is either nondecreasing or nonincreasing with respect to that variable. Therefore, in the circuit representation of unate functions, each variable appears either in its original form or in complemented form. Thus,",
        "\ud835\udc65\u2295\ud835\udc66=(\ud835\udc65\u2227\u00ac\ud835\udc66)\u2228(\u00ac\ud835\udc65\u2227\ud835\udc66) is not a unate function. Moreover, two Boolean functions are said to be equivalent if they are equivalent under the permutation of variables. For example,  \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66)=\ud835\udc65 is equivalent to \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66)=\ud835\udc66 under the permutation of input variables."
