        "The duplication distance between two sequences is the minimum number of duplications required to convert the shorter sequence to the longer one.",
        "So for each binary sequence s of length n, we are looking for the number duplication operations of the form x = abc --> y = abbc, where x and y are sequences and a, b, and c are their substrings, needed to generate s starting from a squarefree sequence from the set {0, 1, 01, 10, 010, 101}.",
        "Then a(n) will be the maximum of the duplication distance over all binary sequences."
