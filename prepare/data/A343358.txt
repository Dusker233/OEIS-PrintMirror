    "comment": [
        "Consider a closed planar curve which crosses itself n times. Build a graph in which crossings are vertices, and two crossings c, d are not connected [connected] if respectively it is [is not] possible to travel along the curve from c to c without passing through d. A graph which can be produced in this way is called realizable. A classical related concept is that of a Gauss diagram (of a closed planar curve); realizable graphs are exactly the circle graphs of realizable Gauss diagrams.",
        "The entries are produced by our code, and the entry for n=11 is corroborated by Section 4 in Bishler et al. which lists 6 pairs of alternating mutant knots of size 11. The entries for n=12, 13 are similarly corroborated by Stoimenow's data."

This is because an alternating prime knot with 10 or fewer crossings is uniquely defined by the graph of the corresponding closed planar curve. Only starting from n=11 some alternating knots which share the same graph but are distinct knots (called \"mutant knots\") start appearing.",
