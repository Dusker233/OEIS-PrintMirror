Sequence lists the index numbers of the cells which are 0 or a prime in R.",

        "R is the ring of integers in the quadratic number field Q(sqrt(-2)). The element x+y*sqrt(-2) in R has norm x^2+2*y^2.",

        "A341784 gives the norms of the primes in R, and A345438 gives the numbers of primes of those norms."
