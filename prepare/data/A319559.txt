        "In a set system, two vertices are equivalent if in every block the presence of the first is equivalent to the presence of the second. The T_0 condition means that there are no equivalent vertices.",
        "The weight of a set system is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices."
