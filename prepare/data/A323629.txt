        "The set consists of 96, 128, 144, 160, 176, and all multiples of 8 that are greater than or equal to 192. The values 200, 216, 232, 248, 264, 280 are by Golan, Pratt, and Wagon; these are sufficient to give all further entries that are 8 (mod 16). Freiman and Litsyn proved that there is some M so that the list beyond M consists of all multiples of 8.",
