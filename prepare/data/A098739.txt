    "comment": [
        "The idea for the sequence came from the way long DNA sequences are produced from only four bases, namely, A,T,G,C. Nature is able to produce remarkable species on Earth by permuting these four bases in an apparent random order. The connection between the arrangement of DNA bases in the chromosomes of species and the number system is poorly understood."
