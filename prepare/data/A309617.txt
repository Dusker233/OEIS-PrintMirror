    "comment": [
        "What would a dead end be? We have here a(8) = 8329 though a(8) = 8229 is sound (and lexicographically better); but 8229 brings the sequence to an end after a(9) = 9233 and a(10) = 10238 (indeed, 10238 can't be followed by anything without a contradiction). It is unknown by the authors if this sequence is finite or not."
