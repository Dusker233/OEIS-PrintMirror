        "A self-descriptive number in base b has b digits, indexed by 0 ... b-1 and for all n, the n-th digit equals the number of n's in the number. In base 10 there is exactly one such number, 6210001000.",
        "From _Iain Fox_, Sep 16 2020: (Start)",
        "(b-4)*b^(b-1) + 2*b^(b-2) + b^(b-3) + b^3 is in this sequence for b=4 and b>6.",
        "For b>6, there exists exactly one self-descriptive number of base b. This number is of the form stated in the comment above.",
        "Proof: A number in this sequence is of the form x_0*b^(b-1) + x_1*b^(b-2) + ... + x_{b-2}*b + x_{b-1} where x_i is an integer on the interval [0, b-1] and represents the number of times i appears in the sequence d = x_0, x_1, ..., x_{b-1}. Trivially, x_0 > 0. Let p be the number of nonzero terms in the sequence d. It is easy to see that p = Sum_{i=1..b-1} x_i. Since x_0 > 0, the number of nonzero terms in the sequence e = x_1, x_2, ..., x_{b-1} is p-1. Since the sum of the terms of e is one more than the number of nonzero terms in e, one term of e is 2 and the rest are either 0 or 1. This means that the only terms that can be in d are 0, 1, 2, and x_0, and thus there can be a maximum of four nonzero terms in d. Since there is a maximum of four nonzero terms in d, it is trivial that, for b>6, x_0>2. Thus, for b>6, there are exactly four nonzero terms in d. It is simple to determine that the four nonzero terms are x_0 = b-4, x_1 = 2, x_2 = 1, and x_{x_0} = x_{b-4} = 1.",
