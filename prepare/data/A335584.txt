        "Let a = p_1 * p_2 *...* p_k and b = q_1 * q_2 *...* q_k be two Charmichael numbers (A002997) with the same number of factors, where p_1 < p_2 <...< p_k and q_1 < q_2 <...< q_k are primes. We say that a and b are in the same family iff the vectors [p_1 - 1, ..., p_k - 1] and [q_1 - 1, ..., q_k - 1] are parallel. In other words, the ratios (p_1-1):(p_2-1):...:(p_k-1) and (q_1-1):(q_2-1):...:(q_k-1) are equal. Sequence gives Carmichael numbers that are NOT minimal in their family.",
