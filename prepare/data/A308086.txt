        "Subsequence of A287591 (Carmichael numbers that are arithmetic means of cousin primes). Calculated from _Amiram Eldar_'s table in that sequence. The Carmichael numbers here are contained within intervals defined by prime triples of the form (p, p+2, p+6); therefore, for each term, four consecutive odd numbers are prime, prime, Carmichael number (divisible by 3), then prime. None of the terms of A287591 available so far are contained within intervals defined by prime triplets of the form (p, p+4, p+6). Is that possible? If so, is it also possible for a Carmichael number to be immediately preceded and succeeded by twin primes, i.e., to be \"contained\" in a prime quadruplet? (Such Carmichael numbers would necessarily be multiples of 15.)"

        "656601 = 3*11*101*197 is a term because 656597 and 656599 are twin primes, 656601 is a Carmichael number, and 656603 is also a prime."
