    "comment": [
        "Projective planes of order q can be seen as a set of v=q^2+q+1 subsets (the lines) of size q+1 of a set of v points with the property that any two distinct lines have exactly one point in common. Obviously, this also holds for any of the v! permutations of the points. However, some of these permutations map the points of a given line l of the plane to the points of another line l' thereby fixing the set of lines and consequently the whole projective plane. These permutations form a subgroup called the collineation group or semilinear group PGammaL of the projective plane. The size of this group is given by A373501. Therefore, a(q) is the index of the collineation subgroup in the symmetric group of the points where q=A246655(n)."
