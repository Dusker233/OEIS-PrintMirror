        "No more terms < 100000. It is nearly certain that no terms exist beyond 805.",
        "Let f(k) be the sum of digits of 7^k. Let d be the number of digits, i.e., d=ceiling(log_10(7^k)).",
        "Let s(m) be the sum of m random digits (each drawn independently from a uniform distribution over the integers 0 through 9).",
        "As k increases, the behavior of f(k)/k becomes increasingly similar to that of s(d)/k.",
        "The mean and variance of s(d)/k are 4.5*d/k and 28.5*d/k^2, respectively.",
        "For large values of k, the distribution of s(d)/k approaches a standard normal distribution with mean 4.5*log_10(7) (approximately 3.80294) and variance 28.5*log_10(7)/k.",
        "The probability P(k) that s(d)/k departs from the mean by an amount at least sufficient to reach the nearest higher or lower integer (so that k divides the sum of digits) becomes vanishingly small (e.g., P(50000) < 10^-18, P(100000) < 10^-36, P(150000) < 10^-54), and the same is true of the sum of P(i) for all i >= k (this sum is less than 10^-33 at k=100000).
