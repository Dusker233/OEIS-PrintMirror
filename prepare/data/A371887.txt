        "From _David A. Corneth_, Apr 11 2024: (Start)",
        "This sequence is well defined as A030000 is well defined; every finite string of digits is contained in some power of 2.",
        "An upper bound for a(n), n > 1, can be found by solving 2^k == 2^a(n-1) (mod 10^m) where m is the number of digits of 2^a(n-1) (cf. A034887). This gives a(n) <= k = a(n-1) + 4*5^(m-1) (cf. A005054). So a(5) <= 507 + 4*5^152, which is about 7*10^106. (End)"
