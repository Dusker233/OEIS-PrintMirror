        "Of the first 10^2, 10^6, and 10^10 positive integers, 17%, 40.8%, and 48.4%, respectively, are in the sequence (See Robert G. Wilson's table below). So the conjecture here is that if this trend continues then as the numbers approach infinity, the percentage of those numbers whose sum of divisors is divisible by 10 approaches 100%.",
