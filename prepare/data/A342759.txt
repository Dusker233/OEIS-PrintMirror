    "comment": [
        "Take a square sheet of paper and fold it first vertically and then horizontally so that the bottom right corner stays in place. After each fold, unfold the paper and draw a line along each crease that is indented inwards (along which water would flow); upward creases (ridges) are not marked.",
        "After two folds, we again have a (smaller and thicker) square, and we repeat the process.",
        "After n individual folds, when the paper is unfolded the lines form a planar graph G(n). The numbers of regions, vertices, edges, and connected components in G(n) are given in the present sequence, A146528 (still to be confirmed), A342761, and A342762.",
        "The number of vertices of degree 1 after n+1 folds appears to be A274230(n).",
        "We ignore the folk theorem that says no sheet of paper can be folded more than seven times."
