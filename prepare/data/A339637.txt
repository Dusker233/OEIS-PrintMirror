    "comment": [
        "Let C be the Cantor numbers (A005823), and let A be the set of integers congruent to 1 (mod 3) representable as the quotient of two nonzero elements of C. It is easy to see that if (3/2)*3^i < n < 2*3^i for some i, then n cannot be in A. Initial empirical data suggested that these are the only integers congruent to 1 (mod 3) not in A. However, there are additional \"sporadic\" counterexamples enumerated by A339636, whose structure is not well understood.",
        "A simple automaton-based (or breadth-first search) algorithm can establish in O(n) time whether n is in A or not."
