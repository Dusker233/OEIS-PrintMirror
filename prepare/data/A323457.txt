        "A set A of positive integers is called \"special above n\" iff every element x > n of A divides the product of all elements y < x of A and does not divide any element y > x; an empty product is taken to be 1.",
        "This is a corrected version of A191550, which was based on Friedman (2000), and has terms 1,1,2,5,8,37,26984.",
        "The entries for a(4), a(5), a(6) appear to be wrong. I added the explicit example that shows a(4) >= 9 (and the proof that a(4) <= 9 is easy). I also added the estimate a(5) > 2^2^2^33. An explicit listing proving this is in the Links; that construction is due to Jim Henle. The 2^2^2^33 lower bound for a(5) makes the comment (retained) that a(7) >= 2^2^2^60 seem suspect: it is surely very much larger than this.",
