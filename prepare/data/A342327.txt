    "name": "Number of sets in the geometry determined by the Hausdorff metric at each location between two sets defined by a complete bipartite graph K(5,n) (with n at least 4) missing three edges, where all three removed edges are incident to different vertices in the 5-point set but exactly two removed edges are incident to the same vertex in the other set.",
    "comment": [
        "Start with a complete bipartite graph K(5,n) with vertex sets A and B where |A| = 5 and |B| is at least 4. We can arrange the points in sets A and B such that h(A,B) = d(a,b) for all a in A and b in B, where h is the Hausdorff metric. The pair [A,B] is a configuration. Then a set C is between A and B at location s if h(A,C) = h(C,B) = h(A,B) and h(A,C) = s. Call a pair ab, where a is in A and b is in B an edge. This sequence provides the number of sets between sets A' and B' at location s in a new configuration [A',B'] obtained from [A,B] by removing three edges, where all three removed edges are incident to different points in A but exactly two removed edges are incident to the same point in B. So this sequence tells the number of sets at each location on the line segment between A' and B'.",
        "Number of {0,1} 5 X n matrices (with n at least 4) with three fixed zero entries where exactly two zero entries occur in one column and no row has more than one zero entry, with no zero rows or columns.",
        "Take a complete bipartite graph K(5,n) (with n at least 4) having parts A and B where |A| = 5. This sequence gives the number of edge covers of the graph obtained from this K(5,n) graph after removing three edges, where all three removed edges are incident to different vertices in A but exactly two removed edges are incident to the same vertex in B."
