        "By 'binary tree' we mean a rooted, ordered tree which is either empty, denoted by 0, or it has both a left subtree L and a right subtree R (which can be empty), and then it is denoted by (LR) if it is attached by a contiguous edge to its parent, [LR] if attached by a non-contiguous edge, or LR if it is does not have a parent, i.e., if is the root. A contiguous edge in the pattern tree corresponds to a parent-child relation in the host tree (as in Rowland's paper), whereas a non-contiguous edge in the pattern tree corresponds to an ancestor-descendant relation in the host tree (as in the paper by Dairyko, Pudwell, Tyner, and Wynn).",
