        "This sequence describes the optimal solution of the 2D generalization of the well-known nine dots problem, published in Loyd\u2019s Cyclopedia of Puzzles (1914), p. 301.",
        "Since Solomon Golomb constructively proved that, for any n >= 3, the minimum-link polygonal chain covering a given {0,1,...,n-1} X {0,1,...,n-1} grid consists of (exactly) 2*(n - 1) line segments, we only need to find the shortest trail satisfying the constraint above.",
        "In detail, if n = 2, the trivial spanning path (0,1)-(0,0)-(1,0)-(1,1) is optimal. If n = 3, we have the classic solution of the nine dots problem (0,1)-(0,3)-(3,0)-(0,0)-(2,2). Now, if n > 3, a valid upper bound is given by n^2 + 5*sqrt(2) - 3, but it is possible to improve this solution for the n = 5 case by providing the trail.",
        "(2,3)-(4,3)-(1,0)-(1,3)-(4,0)-(0,0)-(0,4)-(4,4)-(4,1), whose total Euclidean length is 20 + 6*sqrt(2). In the end, assuming n > 5, we can recycle the mentioned solution, then extend the last line segment to reach (4,-1), and finally apply the square spiral pattern to the (extended) ending segment of the {0,1,...,n-1} X {0,1,...,n-1} grid solution in order to get the solution for the {0,1,...,n} X {0,1,...,n} case, joining 2*n + 1 more points by spending two additional line segments having a combined length of 2*n (and this is an iterative strategy which is optimal for any n > 5)."
