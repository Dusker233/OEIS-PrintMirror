All terms between lower(k) and upper(k) are represented by a (k+7)-binary-digit number (see A306515). Each m-binary-digit number will have a successive number of m+1 binary digits in the next range. About 1/4 of each obtained number in this sequence has a new unique cyclic trajectory (see A306516 and A306517), i.e., a cyclic trajectory not joining a previous cyclic trajectory, which explains the growth factor of 4/3 for each successive range.",
