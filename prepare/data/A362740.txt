        "In a 01-labeled graph each vertex v has a label l(v) from the set {0, 1}. The 01-labeled graphs on n vertices are in a one-to-one correspondence with the rooted unlabeled graphs on n+1 vertices (cf. A000666).",
        "An invariant is a function that takes the same values on isomorphic 01-labeled graphs. A 4-invariant f is an invariant such that for any 01-labeled graph G and any pair of vertices A,B connected by an edge in G,",
