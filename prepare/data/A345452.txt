        "The above property arises because the sequence lists the integers in the multiplicative subgroup of positive rational numbers generated by the squares of primes (A001248) and the products of two consecutive odd primes (A006094\\{6}).",
        "The sequence is closed under multiplication, prime shift (A003961), and - where the result is an integer - under division. Using these closures, all the terms can be derived from the presence of 4 and 15. For example, A003961(4) = 9, A003961(9) = 25, A003961(15) = 35, 15 * 35 = 525, 525/25 = 21. Alternatively, the sequence may be defined as the closure of A046337 under multiplication by 4.",
        "From the properties of subgroups of the positive rationals we know that if we take an absent positive integer m and divide all terms that are multiples of m by m, we get all the integers in the same subgroup coset as m, and we can expect some of the nice properties here to carry over to the resulting set. Specifically, dividing the even terms by 2 gives all numbers with an odd number of prime factors that sum to an even number; dividing all terms divisible by an odd prime p by p, gives all numbers with an odd number of prime factors that sum to an odd number. The positive integers satisfying the 4th of the 4 possibilities are generated similarly, dividing by 6 (for example).",
