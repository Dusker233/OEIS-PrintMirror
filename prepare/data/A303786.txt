        "For any pair of contiguous terms, one of the terms uses fewer digits than the other. This term is called the mask. Put the mask on the other term, starting from the left. What is not covered by the mask rebuilds, term by term, the starting sequence.",
        "The n-th term of the sequence has exactly 2^(n-1) digits, which means that a(21) has more than one million digits.",
        "The sequence starts with a(1) = 1, then a(n) = 10^(2^(n-1)-1)+a(n-1)."
