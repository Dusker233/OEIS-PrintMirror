        "Conjectures: 1) For prime p, the sequence taken modulo p is purely periodic with minimum period dividing 2*(p - 1). For example, taken modulo 5 the sequence becomes [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, ...], which appears to be a purely periodic sequence of period 8.",
        "2) For composite n, the sequence taken modulo n is eventually periodic. For example, taken modulo 24 the sequence becomes [1, 3, 17, 15, 1, 15, 17, 15, 1, 15, 17, 15, 1, 15, ...], apparently with pre-period 2 and period 4."
