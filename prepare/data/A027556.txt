        "a(n) is also the number of different ways to fold down a folding yardstick with n sticks (stick length is one) to form an equilateral triangle with side length one. E.g., mark the vertices of the triangle as 1, 2 and 3. Having a yardstick with n = 3 sticks there are two ways of folding to form an equilateral triangle: 1-2-3-1 and 1-3-2-1. For n = 4 there are six ways of folding: 1-2-3-1-2 or 3; 1-3-2-1-2 or 3; 1-2-1-3-2 and 1-3-1-2-3. - _Frank Hollstein_, Apr 23 2019"
