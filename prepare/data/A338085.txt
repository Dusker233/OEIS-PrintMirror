    "comment": [
        "In George Andrews\u2019s partition notation, exponents mean repeated addition, not repeated multiplication. So (p^K)(q^L) with p<q denotes K parts of size p, combined with L parts of size q, thus a rectangle of width q and depth L atop another rectangle of width p and depth L in the Ferrers diagram. Given a partition Lambda(n)=(p1^E1)(p2^E2)...(pj^Ej) with all Ek>0 and the parts pk arranged in increasing order, suppose E1p1+E2p2+..Ekpk>p(k+1) for some 1<k<j. Then Lambda(n) is in S(n).",
        "For any partition in S, the number of parts must be at least 3, with at least 2 distinct parts.",
        "The sequence a(n) is nondecreasing since if a(n-1)=t, then t distinct elements of S(n) can be formed by putting a dot in the lower left corner of the Ferrers diagram for each element of S(n-1).",
        "Closure: Given a partition X in S(x) and partition Y in S(y): The partition X+Y given by concatenation is in S(x+y). So a(x)+a(y) might be provably less than or equal to S(x+y). X and Y can be multiplied to give a partition XY in S(xy). The two operations obey distributivity of multiplication over addition."

        "(4^2)(7^3), a partition of 29, is in S(29) since 2*4=8>7.",
        "Also, (1^3)(3^2)(7^1)(20^4), a partition of 96, is in S(96) since 3*1+2*3=9>7.",
        "But (1^3)(4^5) is not in S(23) because 3*1 is not greater than 4."
