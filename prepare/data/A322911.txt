        "A multiset multisystem is a finite multiset of finite multisets. A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. The multiset multisystem with MM-number n is formed by taking the multiset of prime indices of each part of the multiset of prime indices of n. For example, the prime indices of 78 are {1,2,6}, so the multiset multisystem with MM-number 78 is {{},{1},{1,2}}. The dual of a multiset multisystem has, for each vertex, one block consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}. The sequence lists all MM-numbers of multiset multisystems whose dual is constant, i.e. of the form {x,x,x,...,x} for some multiset x."
