        "This sequence is from a Project Euler problem called \"Tom and Jerry\". A cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry play a game on a graph G. Each vertex of G is a mousehole. Jerry starts in one of the vertices. Every day, Tom tries to catch Jerry in one of the holes. If there is a vertex adjacent to Jerry's hole, then Jerry moves to one of the adjacent holes. A Tom graph is a graph on which Tom can always catch Jerry by following a sequence of holes.",

        "In order to find a term of the current sequence, the number of trees containing the shown subgraph must be subtracted from the total number A000055. For n = 10 this is exactly one, for n = 11 it is trivially 4 and for n = 12 it is 19 (A130132).",

        "The formulas of A005195 (Euler transform) can then be used to calculate the number of forests if the reduced number of trees A130131 is used instead of A000055. (End)",
