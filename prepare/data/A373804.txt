        "Since we know the first 350199 terms of A374965, and A374965(350199) = 5026186 starts a new doubling chain, we know that any subsequent prime is greater than 5026186. This implies that the terms in the b-file, which are < 5026186, are correct. Of course, if the sequence reaches a Riesel number (cf. A076337) there will be no more primes after that point.",
        "Note that, as can be seen from the b-file in A375028, A374965 contains many primes greater than 5026186 among the first 350199 terms, including one prime with 102410 digits. But these large primes cannot be added to the present b-file until more is discovered about primes following term 350199."
