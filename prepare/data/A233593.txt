        "For more details about this type of expansions, see A233582.",
        "The cases with known periodic expansions, listed in A233592, all become periodic after just two leading terms. In contrast, the Blazys's expansion of sqrt(a(k)) for every member a(k) of this list remains aperiodic up to at least 1000 terms. It is therefore conjectured, though not proved, that these expansions are indeed aperiodic."
