        "If the condition \"greater than\" were changed to \"greater than or equal to\" the sequence would also include the number 396, where the proportion is the same as at 1089, namely, 156/396 = 429/1089 = 39/99. There seems to be no other such coincidence. There is none up to 2*10^11.",
        "All the terms are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. If the modulus 36 is considered, the only possible residue classes are 0, 1, 9, 12, 20, 28, 29, 32 and 33. Similar restrictions hold for larger moduli. Thus, mod 900 there are only 132 possible residues, the least one being 28. Of these, more than half appear in pairs of two consecutive values."
