        "The terms are proposed without repetition. For example, there exist two such triangles with a length of side = 33. They correspond respectively to s^2 - r^2 = 33 (see formula) with (r, s) = (4, 7) and sides (33, 28, 16), and the other triangle with (r, s) = (16, 17) and sides (33, 272, 256). Lengths = 39, 51, 57, 69, 75, ... correspond to two distinct triangles ... The lengths of these sides are proposed with repetition in A343064. - _Bernard Schott_, Apr 22 2021"
