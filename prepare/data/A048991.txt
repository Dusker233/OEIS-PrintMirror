        "Similar to the \"punctual birds\" A131881, numbers which do not occur earlier than their \"natural\" position in the string 123...9101112..., but more complex to compute due to the fact that here the omitted numbers must be taken into account. Contains powers of ten A011557 as a subsequence, at indices (1, 10, 63, 402, 2954, ...), giving the number of n-digit terms as (9, 53, 339, 2552, ...). - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 25 2019"
