        "a(n) is also the n-digit integer that minimizes the mean square error of the approximation sin(x+m) for cos(x) over [0, 2*Pi].",
        "Naturally, sin(a(n)) is the best approximation to 1 for an n-digit integer argument. a(n) is the closest integer to an n-digit number of the form (4k+1)*Pi/2. Often used to compute an approximated rotation matrix with just a few number of characters of code, as in M = sin(x+{0,699,-699,0}). It is not guaranteed that each term in the sequence produces a better approximation than the previous one, although numerical evidence suggests so. It is therefore also not guaranteed to be a subsequence of A046959."

    "example": [
        "For n=3, a(3)=699 since no other 3-digit integer m makes sin(x+m) closer to cos(x) than m=699 does. For example, cos(4.5) = -0.210795799... and sin(4.5+699) = -0.215061112... and no other value of m will make the latter closer to the former."
