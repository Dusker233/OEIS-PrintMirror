        "This sequence and the other bisection A309224 are initially very similar: there appear to be blocks of terms that are identical except that the initial terms differ by 1. For example, [30, 36, 43, 49, 58, 66, 75] here versus [31, 36, 43, 49, 58, 66, 75] in A309224. Is there a simple explanation? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 31 2019"
