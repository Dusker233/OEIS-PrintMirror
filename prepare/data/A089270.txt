It appears that k=5 is the only k for which x^2 = x+1 (mod k) has just one solution. The first k producing 4 solutions is 209. The first k producing 8 solutions is 6061. - _T. D.

For each number, he also lists the (a,b) pairs that are the first two terms of a unique Fibonacci sequence. [These numbers are not discriminants, which is evident from the fact that not all of them are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. Although Brousseau denotes them with D, he calls them \"quantity ... which is characteristic of any given sequence\". The same list can be found in the letter to N. J. A. Sloane by Hoggatt, Jr. where the numbers are called \"characteristic numbers of Fibonacci sequences\". Finally, Matthew Staller in his comment below calls them \"determinants\", which is probably the most appropriate term. - _Klaus Purath_, Sep 08 2022]",

For example, n=187891=11*19*29*31 has 16=2^4 solutions; the prime n=9999999929 has 2=2^1 solutions; n=84182245951=31^3*41^4 has 4=2^2 solutions. [For a proof of the conjecture see the W.

        "Recurring sequences (as Fibonacci sequences) may be ordered by determinant (|y^2 - x^2 - x*y| for consecutive (x,y) terms), and further by individual terms to clarify where necessary. For example, the four distinct sequences that have a determinant of 209 are (13,8), (13,5), (14,13), (14,1), which shows how they were found but which would be more commonly understood as (8,21), (5,18), (13,27), (1,15). For a determinant of 1 there is exactly one sequence (Fibonacci, A000045); for a determinant of 5 there is just one (Lucas, A000032). For 11 there are two (1,4) and (2,5), the latter of which is known as the Evangelist Sequence (A001060).",
