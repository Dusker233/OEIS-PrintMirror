    "name": "For each positive integer m there exist at least one prime Q=Q(m) and at least one prime P=P(m) such that (2m-1)^2 < Q < (2m)^2 - (2m-1) <= P < (2m)^2. Sequence lists pairs P(m), Q(m) for m >= 1. If more than one prime for P or Q exists, we take the smallest.",

        "In some intervals there is one prime only: Q(1)=2, P(1)=3, Q(2)=11, P(2)=13, Q(3)=29, P(3)=31, Q(4)=53, P(5)=97.",
