        "Suggested by the Wilson-Lagrange Theorem: An integer p > 1 is a prime if and only if (p-1)! == -1 (mod p). Cf. Wilson quotients, A007619.",
        "Sequence is believed to be infinite. Next term is known to be > 2*10^13 (cf. Costa et al., 2013).",
        "Intersection of the Wilson numbers A157250 and the primes A000040. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Mar 04 2016",
        "Conjecture: Odd primes p such that 1^(p-1) + 2^(p-1) + ... + (p-1)^(p-1) == p-1 (mod p^2). - _Thomas Ordowski_ and _Giovanni Resta_, Jul 25 2018",

        "Harry S. Vandiver apparently said about the Wilson primes \"It is not known if there are infinitely many Wilson primes. This question seems to be of such a character that if I should come to life any time after my death and some mathematician were to tell me that it had definitely been settled, I think I would immediately drop dead again.\" (cf. Ribenboim, 2000, p. 217).",
        "Let p be a Wilson prime and let i be the index of p in A000040. For n = 1, 2, 3, the values of i are 3, 6, 103. The primes among those values are Lerch primes, i.e., terms of A197632. Is this a property that necessarily follows if i is prime (cf. Sondow, 2011/2012, 2.5 Open Problems 5)? (End)",
        "From _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 16 2021: (Start)",
        "Named after the English mathematician John Wilson (1741-1793) after whom \"Wilson's theorem\" was also named.",
        "The primes 5 and 13 appear in an exercise involving the Wilson congruence in Mathews (1892). [Edited by _Felix Fr\u00f6hlich_, Jul 23 2021]",
        "Beeger found that there are no other smaller terms up to 114 (1913) and up to 200 (1930).",
        "a(3) = 563 was found by Goldberg (1953), who used the Bureau of Standards Eastern Automatic Computer (SEAC) to search all primes less than 10000. According to Goldberg, the third prime was discovered independently by Donald Wall six month later. (End)"
