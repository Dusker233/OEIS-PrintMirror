The number of solutions modulo n is Product_{i not in S} gcd(2^d, p_i-1). Hence we have C(n) = Sum_{S subset of {1,2,...,k}} Product_{i not in S} gcd(2^d, p_i - 1) = Product_{i=1..k} (1 + gcd(2^d, p_i-1)).",

By Zsigmondy's Theorem, unless d = 1 or 3, 2^d + 1 has a primitive prime factor p such that p does not divide 2^e + 1 for all e < d. So we must have d = 1 or 3 (otherwise p does not divide Product_{i=1..k} (1 + gcd(2^d, p_i-1))), then k = 1 or 2. But a Carmichael number must have at least 3 prime factors, a contradiction! (End)",
