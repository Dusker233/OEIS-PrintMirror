    "comment": [
        "The graphs are directed, connected and have indegree=outdegree=2 at each node. Multiarcs (connecting two nodes with the same sense of heading) and loops (edges connecting a node to itself) are permitted.",
        "The sequence of the same family of graphs which are not necessarily connected is A006372 (the Euler transform of this sequence)."
