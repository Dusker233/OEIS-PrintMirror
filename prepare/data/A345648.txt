        "For n = 0 to n = 11 the number of polygons formed outside the n x n square is less than the number formed inside the square. This changes for n >= 12 when the number formed outside becomes greater. The ratio of the number of polygons outside to the number inside for n = 26 is about 1.07 . If this ratio is unbounded or approaches some finite value as n -> infinity is not known.",
