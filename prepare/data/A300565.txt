        "Consider a solution (x, y, z), x^3 + y^4 = z^5. For any m, (x*m^20, y*m^15, z*m^12) will also be a solution. If (x/m^20, y/m^15, z/m^12) is a triple of integers, it is also a solution. A solution is called primitive if there is no such m > 1.",

All known terms are of this form, with b in {2, 6, 7, 9, 12}, only for a(2) and a(10) one must consider half-integral b = 5/2 resp. 31/2.
