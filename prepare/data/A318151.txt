    "comment": [
        "If n = 1 let e(n) be the leaf symbol \"o\". Given a positive integer n > 1 we construct a unique orderless expression e(n) (as can be represented in functional programming languages such as Mathematica) with one atom by expressing n as a power of a number that is not a perfect power to a product of prime numbers: n = rad(x)^(prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k)) where rad = A007916. Then e(n) = e(x)[e(y_1), ..., e(y_k)]. For example, e(21025) = o[o[o]][o] because 21025 = rad(rad(1)^prime(rad(1)^prime(1)))^prime(1). The sequence consists of all numbers n such that e(n) contains no subexpressions in heads f[x_1, ..., x_k][y_1, ..., y_k] where k,j >= 0."
