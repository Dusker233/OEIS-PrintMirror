        "Essentially (i.e., except for the initial term), the same as A003617. The definition is misleading, since \"n-th significant digit\" seems to mean here \"most significant digit\" (except for a(1)), while the \"significance\" is decreasing when going from the first to the last digit. (E.g., 1234 rounded to 2 significant digits is 1200, so \"1,2\" should be the first and second (and not fourth and third) significant digits.) [_M. F. Hasler_, Jun 03 2009]"
