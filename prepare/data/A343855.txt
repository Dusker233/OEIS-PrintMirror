        "All terms have last digit either 1, 4, 6, or 9. A term cannot have last digit 0 since that would mean one of the squares ends in an odd number of zeros and all squares end in an even number of zeros. A term cannot have last digit 5 since squares ending in 5 have 25 as last 2 digits and there are no squares having last digit 2. The last 2 digits of terms must be one of 01, 04, 09, 16, 41, 44, 49, 56, 61, 64, 69, 96. - _Chai Wah Wu_, May 27 2021"
