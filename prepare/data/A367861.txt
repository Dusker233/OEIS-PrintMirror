        "We define the multiset multiplicity cokernel MMC(m) of a multiset m by the following property, holding for all distinct multiplicities k >= 1. If S is the set of elements of multiplicity k in m, then max(S) has multiplicity |S| in MMC(m). For example, MMC({1,1,2,2,3,4,5}) = {2,2,5,5,5}, and MMC({1,2,3,4,5,5,5,5}) = {4,4,4,4,5}. As an operation on multisets MMC is represented by A367858, and as an operation on their ranks it is represented by A367859."
