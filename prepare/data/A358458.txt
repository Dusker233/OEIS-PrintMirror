        "We define an unlabeled ordered rooted tree to be weakly transitive if every branch of a branch of the root is itself a branch of the root.",

This ranking is an ordered variation of Matula-Goebel numbers, giving a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled ordered rooted trees."
