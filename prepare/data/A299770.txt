    "name": "a(n) is the total number of elements after n-th stage of a hybrid (and finite) cellular automaton on the infinite square grid, formed by toothpicks of length 2, D-toothpicks, toothpicks of length 1, and T-toothpicks.",
    "comment": [
        "The structure is essentially the same as the finite structure described in A294962 but here there are no D-toothpicks of length sqrt(2)/2. All D-toothpicks in the structure have length sqrt(2).",
        "The same as A294962, it seems that this cellular automaton resembles the synthesis of a molecule, a protein, etc.",
        "After 10th stage there are no exposed endpoints (or free ends), so the structure is finished.",
        "A299771(n) gives the number of elements added to the structure at n-th stage.",
        "The \"word\" of this cellular automaton is \"abcd\". For further information about the word of cellular automata see A296612. - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 05 2019"
