    "comment": [
        "This family of curves quickly reaches a moderate value of rank with a relatively low \"k\" parameter. And is fully analyzed in Tadik's work (see link). Tadik finds 11 terms, a rank lower bound and shows the torsion group is always trivial. The evolution of the rank is shown in detail, finding that a(11) <= 1118245045.",
        "I have sequentially checked the first 10 terms, thus proving that they are the least k for each rank."
