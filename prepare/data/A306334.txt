        "We prove _Vaclav Kotesovec_'s conjectures from the Formula section. Let M = [[0,0,1], [0,1,1], [1,1,1]], X(n) = M^(n-2), and Y(n) = M^(floor(n/2)-2)) = X(floor(n/2)) (with negative powers indicating matrix inverses). Let also, t_1 = [1,1,1]^T, t_2 = [1,2,2]^T, and t_3 = [1,2,3]^T. In addition, define b(n) = (1/2)*(t_1^T X(n) t_1) and c(n) = (1/2)*(t_3^T Y(n) t_1) if n is even and = (1/2)*(t_2^T Y(n) t_1) if n is odd.",
        "We have a(n) = b(n) + c(n) for n >= 1. Since the characteristic polynomial of  _Vaclav Kotesovec_'s recurrence is x^9 - 2*x^8 - 3*x^7 + 5*x^6 + x^5 + 2*x^3 - 3*x^2 - x + 1 = g(x)*g(x^2), where g(x) = x^3 - 2*x^2 - x + 1, to prove his first conjecture, it suffices to show that b(n) - 2*b(n-1) - b(n-2) + b(n-3) = 0 (whose characteristic polynomial is g(x)) and c(n) - 2*c(n-2) - c(n-4) + c(n-6) = 0 (whose characteristic polynomial is g(x^2)).",
        "Note that 2*b(n) = A006356(n-1) for n >= 1. (See the comments by _L. Edson Jeffery_ and _R. J. Mathar_ in the documentation of that sequence.) Also, 2*c(2*n) = A006356(n) and 2*c(2*n-1) = A006054(n+1) for n >= 1.",
        "Properties of the polynomial g(x) = x^3 - 2*x^2 - x + 1 and its roots were studied by Witula et al. (2006) (see Corollary 2.4). This means that a(n) can essentially be expressed in terms of exp(I*2*Pi/7), but we omit the discussion. See also the comments for sequence A006054.",
        "The characteristic polynomial of matrix M is g(x). By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, 0 = g(M) = M^3 - 2*M^2 - M + I_3, and thus, for n >= 5,  X(n) - 2*X(n-1) - X(n-2) + X(n-3) = M^(n-2) - 2*M^(n-3) - M^(n-4) + M^(n-5) = 0. Pre-multiplying by (1/2)*t_1^T and post-multiplying by t_1, we get that b(n) - 2*b(n-1) - b(n-2) + b(n-3) = 0 for n >= 5.",

Pre-multiplying by (1/2)*t_3^T (when n is even) or by (1/2)*t_2^T (when n is odd), and post-multiplying by t_1, we get c(n) - 2*c(n-2) - c(n-4) + c(n-6) = 0 for n >= 10.",
        "Since the characteristic polynomial of _Vaclav Kotesovec_'s recurrence is g(x)*g(x^2), which is a polynomial of degree 9, the denominator of the g.f. of the sequence (a(n): n >= 1) should be x^9*g(1/x)*g(1/x^2) = (1 - 2*x - x^2 + x^3)*(1 - 2*x^2 - x^4 + x^6), as  _Vaclav Kotesovec_ conjectured below. The numerator of  _Vaclav Kotesovec_'s g.f. can be easily derived using the initial conditions (from a(1) = 1 to a(9) = 409). (End)"
