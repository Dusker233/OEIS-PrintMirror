        "There are thirty-nine terms less than 100 million - the terms in the data section along with 95846400. All of these numbers have two ways that they can be written to satisfy their binary value being contained in the binary concatenation of the three divisors; it is unknown if numbers exist that can be written in three or more ways that satisfy this criterion. The only odd number in the first thirty-nine terms is 495; it is unknown if more exist."
