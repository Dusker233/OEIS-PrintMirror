        "On an n X n square board we draw a path with squares that we number 1, 2, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., n, 1, ... of the greatest length, which will be a(n). The path advances from one number to the next horizontally or vertically, not diagonally, after n it goes back to number 1. The path cannot cross itself. There cannot be repeated numbers in the same row or column."
