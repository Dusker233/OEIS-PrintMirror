        "There are certain prime pairs p, q for which the Stern polynomials B(p,t) and B(q,t) (see table A125184) have equal multisets of nonzero coefficients. For example, for primes 191 and 193 these coefficients are {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1} and {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1} (from which follows that A278243(191) = A278243(193), A286378(191) = A286378(193) and thus => a(191) = a(193) => A002487(191) = A002487(193) as well). Other such prime pairs currently known are {419, 461}, {2083, 2143} and {11777, 12799}. Whenever a(p) = a(q) for such a prime pair, then also a(2^k * p) = a(2^k * q) for all k >= 0. It would be nice to know whether there could exist any other cases of a(i) = a(j), i != j, but for example both i and j being odd semiprimes?"
