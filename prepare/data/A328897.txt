        "As only square numbers have an odd number of divisors, for odd k, A005179(k) is usually larger than either A005179(k-1) or A005179(k+1) (or both). This sequence lists the exceptions. There are 71 terms below 10^3, 963 terms below 10^4, 11179 terms below 10^5. It seems that the density of this sequence over all the odd numbers is > 0.2.",
