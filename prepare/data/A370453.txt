        "A twin prime pair (other than {3,5}) is always in the form {6m-1,6m+1}, so the product of the pair is always in the form 36*m^2-1 and a twin prime sum is always in the form 12m.  As such, a twin prime sum can be one more than a twin prime product, but not vice versa, nor can a sum and product ever be equal.",
