        "The differences of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were increasing, so for example the differences of (6,3,1) are (-3,-2). The zeroth differences are the sequence itself, while k-th differences for k > 0 are the differences of the (k-1)-th differences. The differences of all degrees of a sequence are the union of its zeroth through m-th differences, where m is the length of the sequence."
