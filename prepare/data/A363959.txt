        "We consider only polynomials with integer coefficients (Z[x]).",
        "The sequence is increasing, since we can always multiply the best degree n-1 polynomial by x. I suspect (but haven't proven) that if we only considered polynomials with nonzero constant term, we'd get the same sequence.",
