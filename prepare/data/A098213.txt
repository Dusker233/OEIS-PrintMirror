        "The algorithm: Take n consecutive primes starting with the a(n)-th prime: {p(a(n)), ..., p(a(n)+n-1)}. Calculate the absolute differences abs(p(i)-p(j)) for all relevant pairs i,j. The number of distinct entries of this n X n difference matrix equals binomial(n,2) = n(n-1)/2, the maximum possible. Also a(n) is the earliest index such that this diversity of differences reaches the maximum possible, binomial(n,2).",
        "The diagonal [{p(i)-p(i)}] of difference matrices consists only of zeros and can be disregarded.",
        "The complete diversity of k-1 consecutive prime differences [as in A079007] is a necessary but not sufficient condition for providing binomial(k,2) distinct entries in the corresponding k X k difference matrix of k consecutive primes. Consecutive prime differences are para-diagonal entries in the difference matrix. So the conditions here are stronger than in A079007."
