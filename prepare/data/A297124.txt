    "comment": [
        "A number n having base-b digits d(m), d(m-1), ..., d(0) such that d(i) != d(i+1) for 0 <= i < m shows a zigzag pattern of one or more segments, in the following sense.  Writing U for up and D for down, there are two kinds of patterns:  U, UD, UDU, UDUD, ... and D, DU, DUD, DUDU, ... .  In the former case, we say n has an \"up-first zigzag pattern in base b\"; in the latter, a \"down-first zigzag pattern in base b\".  Example:  2,4,5,3,0,1,4,2 has segments 2,4,5; 5,3,0; 0,1,4; and 4,2, so that 24530142, with pattern UDUD, has an up-first zigzag pattern in base 10, whereas 4,2,5,3,0,1,4,2 has a down-first pattern.  The sequences A297124..A297127 partition the natural numbers.  See the guide at A297146."
