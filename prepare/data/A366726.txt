        "The gaps were found empirically using a generalization of the formula which generates Tokuda's good gaps (A108870).  These are a noticeable improvement over Tokuda's sequence when sorting random data, especially where N is in the millions.",
        "The specific gamma = 2.243609061420001 is used to generate the present sequence.  If one were to continue the search for a better gamma, the next best value lies within the range: 2.243609055217999... < gamma <= 2.243609061420001..."
