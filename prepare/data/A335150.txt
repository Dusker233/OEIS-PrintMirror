        "Among the 42352 terms below 2*10^6 we observe that if multiples triangles correspond to a term their middle sides coincide. In this range there are perimeters common to 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 triangles. The first such terms are a(1) = 12, a(4) = 84, a(36) = 1092, a(546) = 20748, a(14273) = 643188, and the corresponding middle sides are 4, 28, 364, 6916, and 214396. - _Giovanni Resta_, May 30 2020"
