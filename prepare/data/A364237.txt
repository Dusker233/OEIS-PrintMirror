    "comment": [
        "If we consider all permutations of {1,2,...,2n-1} such that no subset of consecutive terms from the permutation sums to 0 modulo 2n, then the number of such permutations is given by the number of constructive orderings mentioned in A141599. For example, given the permutation 14325 that satisfies the given conditions, observe that the partial sums modulo 6, namely 1=1, 1+4=5, 1+4+3=2, 1+4+3+2=4, and 1+4+3+2+5=3, are distinct."

Note that 14325 and 52341 are equivalent by reversing the permutations. Furthermore multiplication by 5 on every entry also yields the same equivalence.
