        "P. Freyd (see link) writes: A050318 is \"the number of isomorphism types of [equationally linear Heyting semi-lattices] of order n ..., albeit shifted by 1.\" And: \"A050318 shifted by 1 is the number of isomorphism types of distributive lattices in which any element below a coprime is itself a coprime. Which ... is the same as the number of distributive lattices in which any element above a prime is itself a prime.\" - _Peter Luschny_, Nov 13 2018"
