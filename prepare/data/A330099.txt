        "We define the brute-force normalization of a set-system to be obtained by first normalizing so that the vertices cover an initial interval of positive integers, then applying all permutations to the vertex set, and finally taking the least representative, where the ordering of sets is first by length and then lexicographically.",

        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.",
