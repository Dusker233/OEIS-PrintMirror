    "comment": [
        "For primes p, the period k of the decimal expansion of 1/p divides p-1. This is usually not the case for reciprocals of composites d; instead, the period k always divides phi(d) where phi is Euler's totient function (A000010). This sequence lists the composites d for which k also divides d-1, which satisfies the condition of a pseudoprime, making such composites a sequence of pseudoprimes with respect to the divisibility of d-1 by k."
