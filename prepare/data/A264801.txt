        "This might be called the \"maximum diversity\" menage problem. Arrangements that differ only by rotation or reflection are excluded by the following conditions: Seat number 1 is assigned to person A. Seat number 2 can only be taken by a person of the same gender as A. The second condition forces an mmffmmff... pattern."
