        "Yutsis graphs are connected cubic graphs which can be partitioned into two vertex-induced trees, which are necessarily of the same size. The cut separating both trees contains n+2 edges for a graph on 2n nodes, forming a Hamiltonian cycle in the planar dual if the graph is planar. These graphs are maximal in the number of nodes of the largest vertex-induced forests among the connected cubic graphs (floor((6n-2)/4) for a graph on 2n nodes). Whitney showed in 1931 that proving the 4-color theorem for a planar Yutsis graph implies the theorem for all planar graphs."
