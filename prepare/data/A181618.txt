        "A series of n games are played between two teams. The outcome of each game is either a win, a loss or a draw. A team wins the whole series if it has more wins than its opponent. If the difference between the number of wins of each team is k and there are less than k games remaining in the series, then the remaining games are dead. The outcome of the dead games cannot affect the outcome of the series.",
