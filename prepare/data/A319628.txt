        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one block consisting of the indices (or positions) of the blocks containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.",
        "The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices."
