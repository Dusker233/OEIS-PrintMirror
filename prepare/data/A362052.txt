        "The abundancy index of an integer k is sigma(k)/k, where sigma is the sum-of-divisors function (A000203).",
        "All the perfect numbers (A000396) are practical, and their abundancy index is 2.",
        "If k is a deficient practical number, then sigma(k) = 2*k - 1 (i.e., k is an almost-perfect number, and the only known such numbers are the powers of 2, A000079), so the abundancy index of these numbers approaches to the limit 2 from below.",
        "All the terms are either of the form 2^m*p, where p < 2^(m+1) - 1 is a prime, or of the form 2^m*p^2, where p = 2^(m+1) - 1 is a prime.",
        "This sequence is infinite since the abundancy index of practical numbers can be arbitrarily close to 2 from above: if k = 2^m*p, and p < 2^(m+1) - 1 then k is practical, and its abundancy index is (2-1/2^m)*(1+1/p) < 2 + 2/p. Therefore, for all eps > 0, taking a prime p and m such that 2/eps < p < 2^(m+1) - 1 will yield a practical number k = 2^m*p with 2 < sigma(k)/k < 2 + eps."
