        "Here a digraph may have at most one self loop (cf. A002416).  A winnable configuration is a subset of lit vertices that can be turned off by some toggling sequence.  In this version of the game, the digraph D is not necessarily symmetric so that the number of winnable configurations is 2^rank(A^t) where A^t is the transpose of the adjacency matrix of D.",
        "In the limit as n goes to infinity, the probability that a random configuration on a random digraph is winnable is: Sum_{j>=0} (1/2^j) * (Product_{i>=j+1} (1-2^i))/(Product_{i>=1} (2^i - 2^(j-i))) = 0.610321..."
