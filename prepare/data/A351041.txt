        "The car moves according to the rules of the game of Racetrack, i.e., if P, Q, and R are three successive positions of the car, both coordinates of the second difference (acceleration vector) P - 2Q + R must be 1, 0, or -1. The car starts with zero velocity at a point (x,0) for some integer x >= n, and finishes when it passes, or lands on, the positive x-axis after a complete counterclockwise lap around the origin. The line segments between successive positions must be outside or on the circle with center in (0,0) and radius n."

This can be seen by looking at the y-coordinate only: First, the car must go up to at least y = n and reduce the speed in the y-direction to zero in order to turn downwards; this requires at least A027434(n) steps. Then down to y = -n or below with speed reduced to zero; this requires at least A027434(2*n) steps. Finally, up to at least y = 0 (not necessarily reducing the speed); this requires at least A002024(n) steps.",
