        "Let V=F_p^n be the n-dimensional vector space over the field F_p with p elements, where p is a prime. We call 1-dimensional subspaces <u> and <v> non-orthogonal if the standard scalar product u*v=\\sum_{i=1}^n u_iv_i is nonzero. Let G be the graph with the 1-dimensional subspaces as vertices and edges given by pairs of distinct non-orthognal subspaces. It seems difficult to compute the clique number of G. For p=3, a(n) is this clique number. The given values have been computed with GAP."
