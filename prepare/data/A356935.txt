        "A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. We define the multiset of multisets with MM-number n to be formed by taking the multiset of prime indices of each part of the multiset of prime indices of n. The size of this multiset of multisets is A302242(n). For example, the prime indices of 78 are {1,2,6}, so the multiset of multisets with MM-number 78 is {{},{1},{1,2}}."
