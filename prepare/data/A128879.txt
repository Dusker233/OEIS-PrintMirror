        "Terms are the primes that equal the sum of the r-th powers of the first s triangular numbers. For first 5 listed terms the corresponding pairs of integers r and s are {r,s} = { {4,5}, {12,13}, {26,29}, {27,33}, {90,5} }. There are also known terms corresponding to {r,s} = { {35,285}, {144,5}, {141,37}, {179,13} } which are too large to include."
