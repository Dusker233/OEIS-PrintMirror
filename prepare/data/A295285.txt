    "comment": [
        "Each number n is the first term of the corresponding individual sequence n+22i, and the whole is union of these overlapping sequences. Due to periodicity, there is a single generating function (n-(n-22)*j)/(j-1)^2 for the sequences. However, the function does not provide predictive means for generating A293698, because also terms which are not the roots are generated. The roots appear in each n+22i as finite subsequences of given length, at given steps. There is, however slight but difficult or impossible to predict variability both in the length, which is either 37 or 36, and the step which is either 7810 or 7832. A293698 is union of these subsequences. - _V.J. Pohjola_, Feb 25 2018"
