        "All k < 10^8 have been checked. All of these numbers are multiples of 3.",
        "The observation above is true for every term. Substituting k=j into phi(j) + phi(k) = phi(j+k) gives phi(j) + phi(j) = phi(j+j), i.e., 2*phi(j) = phi(2j), which is true for every positive even number j; thus k=j yields a solution for every positive even number j. Substituting k=2j into phi(j) + phi(k) = phi(j+k) gives phi(j) + phi(2j) = phi(j+2j), i.e., phi(j) + phi(2j) = phi(3j); since phi(j) = phi(2j) for every odd number j, this is equivalent (for odd j) to phi(j) + phi(j) = phi(3j), i.e., 2*phi(j) = phi(3j), which holds for every odd j that is not a multiple of 3; thus, k=2j yields a solution for every odd j that is not a multiple of 3. Consequently, every term of the sequence is an odd multiple of 3. - _Fl\u00e1vio V. Fernandes_, May 10 2022"
