    "comment": [
        "For squarefree numbers k, esigma(k) = k, where esigma is the sum of exponential divisors function (A051377). Thus, if m is a term (esigma(m) > 2m) and k is a squarefree number coprime to m, then esigma(k*m) = esigma(k) * esigma(m) = k * esigma(m) > 2*k*m, so k*m is an exponential abundant number. Therefore the sequence of exponential abundant numbers (A129575) can be generated from this sequence by multiplying with coprime squarefree numbers."
