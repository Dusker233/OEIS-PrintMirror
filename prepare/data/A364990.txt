        "A coreful divisor d of a number k is a divisor with the same set of distinct prime factors as k, or rad(d) = rad(k), where rad(k) is the largest squarefree divisor of k (A007947) (the term \"coreful divisor\" was used by Hardy and Subbarao, 1983).",
        "If k is a term, then also m*k is, for any squarefree m coprime to k. Thus there are infinitely many coreful triperfect numbers, and all of them can be generated from the sequence of primitive terms, which is the subsequence of powerful terms of this sequence. This sequence is c(n) = A064549(A005820(n)), i.e., the triperfect numbers (A005820), multiplied by their squarefree kernel (A007947): 3600, 28224, 1071645696, 1651818858099200, 532098668445696, 317519577357516800, ...",
