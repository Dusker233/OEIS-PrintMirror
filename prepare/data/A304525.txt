        "The star chromatic index of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of a graph such that adjacent edges receive different colors and that on every path and cycle on four edges there are at least three different colors. The values a(n) are the star chromatic indices of the complete graph K_n. For the complete graph K_n, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Mohar and \u0160\u00e1mal conjectured that the star chromatic index is linear in n. For now, only the bounds up to n=9 are known. For n=10, the index is between 20 and 22."
