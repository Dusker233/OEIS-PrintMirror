        "It is conjectured that the subsequence of noncube terms, A045911, is finite (has 6195 terms). But there are infinitely many cubes in this sequence: k^3 if a term if and only if k^3 - (k-1)^3 = 3*k^2 - 3*k + 1 is a nonprime (k-1 is in A257772). For example, for k == 2, 6 (mod 7), 3*k^2 - 3*k + 1 is divisible by 7, so k^3 is a term for k == 2, 6 (mod 7) and k > 2."
