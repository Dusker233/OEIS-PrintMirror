        "a(n) is the number of one-sided Tangles (smooth simple closed curves piecewise-defined by quadrants of circles) which have a dual graph containing n edges, or equivalently, enclose an area of (4*n + Pi)*r^2, where 1/r is the curvature.  By 'one-sided', we mean that we allow rotations but not reflections.",
        "Dual graphs of Tangles are polyedges (A151537), but the only chordless cycles allowed are squares, e.g., this is *not* the dual graph of a Tangle:",
