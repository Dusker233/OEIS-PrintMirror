        "The density of a multiset partition is defined to be the sum of numbers of distinct elements in each part, minus the number of parts, minus the total number of distinct elements in the whole partition. A multiset partition is a tree if it has more than one part, is connected, and has density -1. A cap is a certain kind of non-transitive coarsening of a multiset partition. For example, the four caps of {{1,1},{1,2},{2,2}} are {{1,1},{1,2},{2,2}}, {{1,1},{1,2,2}}, {{1,1,2},{2,2}}, {{1,1,2,2}}. - _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 05 2021"
