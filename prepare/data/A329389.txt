        "The conditions that (a(n)) and (b(n)) be increasing and complementary force the equation a(n) = 6 b(n+1) - b(n), with initial  value b(0) = 1, to have a unique solution; that is, a pair of complementary sequences (a(n)) = (11,16,21,26,31,...) and (b(n)) = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,...). Conjecture: {a(n) - 6 n} is unbounded below and above."
