    "name": "Number of possible dimensions for commutators of n X n matrices; it is independent of the field. Or, given a partition P = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_m) of n with p_1 >= p_2 >= ... >= p_m, let S(P) = sum_j (2j-1)p_j; then a(n) = number of integers that are an S(P) for some partition.",
    "comment": [
        "Or, given such a partition P of n, let T(P) = sum_i p_i^2; then a(n) = number of integers that are a T(P) for some P. While T(P) need not equal S(P) for a given partition, the two sets of integers are equal. Or, expand the infinite product prod_k 1/(1-x^{k^2}y^k) as a power series; then a(n) = number of terms of the form x^my^n having a nonzero coefficient.",
        "The least m for which there are distinct partitions x(1)+...+x(k) of n for which the sums of squares {x(i)^2} are not distinct is 6.  [_Clark Kimberling_, Mar 06 2012]",
        "a(n) is also the number of possible counts of intersection points of n lines in the plane, no three concurrent. This is because n lines, grouped into pencils of size a_1,...,a_k, meet in P=Sum_{i<j} a_i a_j points, and such sums P are bijective with sums of squares S=a_1^2+...+a_k^2, thanks to n^2=S+2P. For example, a(10)=27 since 10 lines can meet in 0, 9, 16, 17, 21, 23, 24, 25 or 27..45 points. [_Alon Amit_, May 20 2019]"
