        "The terms come frequently in runs of consecutive integers. In particular, all intervals [10^k-1, ..., 10^k+(10^k-1)/9], k >= 1, e.g., {9, 10, 11}, {99, 100, ..., 111}, {999, ..., 1111}, ..., are subsequences. For k > 1, the actual intervals are strictly larger than that, to the left: instead of 1, one can subtract 5*(10^(k-1)-1)/9.",
