Let h(k) be 1 if k has exactly 3 ones in its binary expansion and 0 otherwise and let w(k) be the binary weight of k (cf. A000120). Then T(k + 1) = T(k) + h(2*k + 1) + h(2*k + 2) - h(k + 1) = T(k) + h(2*k + 1) + h(2*(k + 1)) - h(k + 1) but as h(2^m * k) = h(k) two terms cancel and we have T(k + 1) = T(k) + h(2*k + 1). If w(2*k + 1) = w(k) + 1 = 3 then w(k) = 2 which holds for k in A018900. (End)"
