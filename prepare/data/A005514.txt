        "Let (c(n): n >= 1) be a sequence of nonnegative integers and let C(x) = Sum_{n>=1} c(n)*x^n be its g.f. Let k be a positive integer. Let a_k = (a_k(n): n >= 1) be the output sequence of the DIK[k] transform of sequence (c(n): n >= 1), and let A_k(x) = Sum_{n>=1} a_k(n)*x^n be its g.f. See Bower's web link below. It can be proved that, when k is even, A_k(x) = ((1/k)*Sum_{d|k} phi(d)*C(x^d)^(k/d) + (1/2)*C(x^2)^((k/2)-1)*(C(x)^2 + C(x^2)))/2.",

Applying the formula for the g.f. of DIK[8] of (c(n): n >= 1) with C(x) = x/(1-x) and k=8, we get _Herbert Kociemba_'s formula below.",
