        "Quoting from p. 3 of Takacs (1993): \"Denote by S_n* the set of all rooted trees with n labeled vertices. ... let us define R as a fixed set of nonnegative integers which always contains 0. Denote by S_n*(R) the subset of S_n* which contains all the trees in S_n* in which the degree of the root is in R and, if j is the degree of any other vertex of a tree, then j-1 \\in R.\"",
        "Quoting from p. 4 of Takacs (1993): \"Theorem 2: The number of trees in S_n*(R) is |S_n^*(R)| = (n - 1)! Coeff. of x^(n-1) in ( Sum_{i \\in R} x^i/i! )^n.\"",
        "When R = {0,1,...,r}, the quantity |S_n*(R)|/n^(n-1) has a probabilistic interpretation related to the generalized birthday problem. Let us \"put balls at random one by one in n boxes until one of the boxes contains r + 1 balls\" (p. 4 in Takacs). We assume that every box has the same probability (i.e., 1/n). Then |S_n*(R)|/n^(n-1) is the probability that at least n balls are needed until the above process stops (i.e., until at least one of the n boxes contains r + 1 balls).",
