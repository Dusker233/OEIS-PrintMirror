        "Most terms m of the sequence have k = omega(m) = 1, only 132 and 16371 with k=3 are found. Further searches did not find any more terms with k >= 3. k has to be odd in any case, this can be easily seen by looking at the parity of the prime factors. Perhaps someone with a stronger computer can find more numbers with k>1, if there are any. [There are no other terms that are not prime powers among the first 1000 terms. - _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 25 2021]"
