    "comment": [
        "A configuration of n non-overlapping congruent spheres in three-dimensional Euclidean space is called ``rigid'' if the Galilean ``rigid-body motions'' of that configuration are the only motions of this system of n spheres that do not change the number of contact points of the configuration. A system consisting of a single sphere is thus rigid. Rigid as well as non-rigid configurations exist when n>1: for example a configuration of two congruent spheres in contact is rigid, while two congruent spheres not in contact with each other are not in a rigid configuration; and so on. The sequence of numbers listed above consecutively from n=1 to n=9 has mainly been computer-generated, by Miranda Holmes-Cerfon (references given below), and agrees with the pertinent computer-generated results found in references by other authors (also given below). The papers by Holmes-Cerfon start listing putatively complete number counts at n=5, respectively n=3, and give these number counts consecutively not only up to n=9, but also for n = 10, ..., 14, namely: 263 for n=10, 1659 for n=11, 11980 for n=12, 98529 for n=13, and 895478 for n=14; however, already for n=11 there are differences compared to the number counts by other authors. Holmes-Cerfon points out that her algorithm may miss some difficult configurations."
