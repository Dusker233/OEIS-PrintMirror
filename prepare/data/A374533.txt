        "For clarity, we write parentheses around parking functions. For n = 3, the a(3) = 11 solutions are the parking functions of length 3 with a lucky second spot: (1,2,1),(1,2,2),(1,2,3),(1,3,2),(2,1,1),(2,1,2),(2,1,3),(2,2,1),(2,3,1),(3,1,2),(3,2,1). There are 5 parking functions of length 3 which do not have a lucky second spot: (1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,3,1),(3,1,1). For all of these, the car which parks in the second spot did not prefer the second spot; these parking functions do not contribute to our count."
