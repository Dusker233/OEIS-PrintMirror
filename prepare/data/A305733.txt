        "The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. A multiset m whose distinct elements are m_1, m_2, ..., m_k with multiplicities y_1, y_2, ..., y_k is reducible if either m is of size 1 or gcd(m_1, ..., m_k) = 1 and the multiset {y_1, ..., y_k} is also reducible."
