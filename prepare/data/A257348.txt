        "Very little is known for certain. Even the trajectories of 2 (A007497) and 5 (A051572) under repeated application of the map x -> sigma(x) (cf. A000203) are only conjectured to be disjoint.",
        "The thousand-term b-file (up to 141441) has been checked to correspond to disjoint trees for 265 iterations of sigma on each term, and every non-term n < 141441 merges (in at most 21 iterations) with an earlier iteration sequence. - _Hans Havermann_, Nov 22 2019",
        "Rather than trees we mean connected components of the graphs with edges x -> sigma(x). The number 1 is a fixed point, i.e., a cycle of length 1 under iterations of sigma, it is not part of a tree. But since sigma(n) > n for n > 1 there are no other cycles. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 21 2019"
