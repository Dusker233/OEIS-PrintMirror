        "For D=3, the least positive y for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 1. The next prime, D, for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 11, but the smallest positive y in this case is also 1, which is equal to the previous record y. So 11 is not a term.",
        "The next prime, D, after 11 for which x^2-D*y^2=-2 has a solution is 19 and the least positive y for which it has a solution is y=3, which is larger than 1, so it is a new record y value. So 19 is a term of A336792 and 3 is a term of this sequence."
