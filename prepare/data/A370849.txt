    "comment": [
        "\"Least\" means that we list the smallest one if there is more than one solution of length n having the same smoothness. \"Smoothest\" means having the least greatest prime factor, A006530. Length means the number of digits in base 10. We consider only nonzero digits since otherwise the somewhat uninteresting solution would most often be 10^(n-1) = (2*5)^(n-1). [Alternatively, one might exclude those solutions by only forbidding multiples of 10: see below.]",
