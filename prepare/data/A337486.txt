        "Consider an initially empty set of primes whose numbers are used to create a given number where each time a number is created those prime factors are removed from the set. If a number cannot be created as all its required prime factors are not currently in the set then all the prime factors of that number are instead added to the set. Start by trying to create the number 2 followed by all other integers. This sequence list the numbers that are created.",

The prime set at that point has 114323 primes, with the maximum number of entries for a single prime being eleven, for 887.",
