        "The average distance between consecutive terms decreases very slowly, and this pattern can be observed in this sequence up to values of m as high as 2^42 where the average distance is about four times lower than at the beginning of the sequence.",
        "It seems that sequences of the form b(n) = (k*prime(n)) mod x exhibit a quasi-periodic sawtooth-like trend with slightly decreasing period when x is a positive irrational and k is the numerator (or a multiple of it) of a convergent to x. The Mathematica program in Links allows an easy experimentation on this feature and similar patterns obtained with other irrational constants x, and integer factors k."
