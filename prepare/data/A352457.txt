        "For each partition p of n, there is a \"Lyndon symmetric function\" L_p which is homogeneous of degree n. The Q-vector space V_n spanned by all Lyndon symmetric functions of degree n is a subspace of the space Lambda^n of all homogeneous symmetric functions over Q of degree n, which has dimension p(n), the number of partitions of n (A000041). Then a(n) is the codimension of V_n in Lambda^n."
