        "This is an extension of the free polyominoes (A000105) to the third dimension. Structures are considered equivalent if they can be mapped into each other by reflection in a vertical plane or rotation around the vertical axis. They are not equivalent if they can only be mapped onto each other by rotation around an axis parallel to the horizontal plane."
