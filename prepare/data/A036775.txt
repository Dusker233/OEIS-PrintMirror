        "A preimage constraint on a function is a set of nonnegative integers such that the size of the inverse image of any element is one of the values in that set. View a labeled rooted tree as an endofunction on the set {1,2,...,n} by sending every non-root node to its neighbor that is closer to the root and sending the root to itself. Thus a(n) is the number of endofunctions on a set of size n with exactly one cyclic point and such that each preimage has at most 3 entries. - _Benjamin Otto_, Apr 08 2019",
        "From pp. 3-4 in Takacs (1993), we see that n is the number of nodes in a labeled rooted tree such that each node has outdegree <= 3, and (as noted above by G. Critzer), a(n) is the number of such unordered rooted labeled trees (with n nodes). - _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jun 09 2019"
