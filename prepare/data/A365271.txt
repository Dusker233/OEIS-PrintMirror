        "To achieve a minimum, we need there to be x regions of area >= 2m-1 and (x-1) regions of area <= 4m-3 and m squares shaded in each of the x smaller regions. It can be shown that it is sufficient to only consider an odd number (2x-1) of regions. A weak lower bound is given in the formula section. Exhaustive searches lead to a stronger lower bound on each term, a(n), by identifying values of x and m which enable us to apportion the n^2 grid squares into rectangular regions with side lengths <= n. We then confirm each term by finding an actual configuration of regions that fits the n X n grid."

(The area of the smaller regions with more than half of their squares shaded is more than half of the area of the larger regions, so the area of the smaller regions is more than one third of the total grid; therefore the number of shaded squares is greater than one sixth of the number of grid squares.)"
