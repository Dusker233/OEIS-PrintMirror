        "From _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 02 2019: (Start)",
        "There is no term below 10^3, but beyond 10^4 they become much more frequent: roughly 1/3 of all numbers between 10^4 and 5*10^4 are in the sequence.",
        "The sequence consists mostly in runs of consecutive numbers ending with the next larger term with final digit 9: 1373..1379, 1382..1389, 1391..1399, 1591..1599, 1891..1899, 2373..2379, ... In some ranges, like a(152) = 4010 to a(240) = 4181, a(307) = 6010 to a(352) = 6391, a(467) = 10010 to a(556) = 11090, ..., this pattern is reversed: the runs start with a multiple of 10.",
        "However, all these terms are so far only conjectural. We have no proof that the terms for which the trajectory seems to \"explode\" do not eventually end up in a cycle. For example, the 8th iterate of a(1) = 1373 is 5218725017016262626273. If the 2nd digit is changed from 2 to 0, then the further iterates grow to a length of 52 digits, but finally end up in a 2-cycle of 45-digit numbers (26...26273, 62...62637).
