        "Although it initially appears that a(n)-8n = the 16-periodic sequence {-2,-6,-10,-14,-18,-22,-26,-30,-34,-38,-42,-46,-50,-54,6,2}, this pattern eventually breaks down. For example, 2^130-2 is in this 16-periodic sequence, so is followed by A102370(2^130-2) = 2^130-2 + 4 + 2^130. However, the first break occurs somewhere beyond the first 400 million terms.",
        "a(n) agrees with the 16-periodic sequence up to a(2^67-1) = 2^70 - 70, but then diverges with a(2^67) = 2^71 - 2. - _Charlie Neder_, Feb 07 2019"
