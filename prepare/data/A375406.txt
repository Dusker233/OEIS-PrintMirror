        "First differs from the non-dashed version A335514 at a(9) = 41, A335514(9) = 42, due to the composition (3,1,3,2).",
        "Also the number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of weakly decreasing runs are not weakly increasing. For example, the composition q = (1,1,2,1,2,2,1,3) has maximal weakly decreasing runs ((1,1),(2,1),(2,2,1),(3)), with leaders (1,2,2,3), which are weakly increasing, so q is not counted under a(13); also q does not match 3-12. On the other hand, the reverse is (3,1,2,2,1,2,1,1), with maximal weakly decreasing runs ((3,1),(2,2,1),(2,1,1)), with leaders (3,2,2), which are not weakly increasing, so it is counted under a(13); meanwhile it matches 3-12, as required."
