        "One can view a circuit with n unit resistors as a multigraph G with n edges and a pair P of distinguished nodes. Every edge of the graph must be contained in a path connecting the two distinguished nodes.",
        "In case n > 0, a(n) counts all resistances R(G, P), which are rational numbers by Kirchhoff's laws. In case n = 0, the graph G consists of only two pair P nodes, and there is only one resistance: oo = infinity; so a(0) = 1. In the OEIS, there are already sequences that count the possible resistances of circuits of certain types (for the definitions see A337516).",
