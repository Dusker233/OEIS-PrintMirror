        "An optimal set delivering a(n) pairs summing to powers of 2 can be formed by n-A357409(n) first negative odd numbers and A357409(n) first positive odd numbers, that is, by the odd numbers in the interval [-2*(n-A357409(n))+1, 2*A357409(n)-1].",
        "a(n) is in many cases equal to A347301(n) but there are some deviations: a(3) = 2 but A347301(3) = 3, a(29) = 62 but A347301(29) = 61, a(31) = 68 but A347301(32) = 67, a(33) = 74 but A347301(33) = 73, ... . Hence it appears that a(n) may be used as an improved lower bound for A352178(n) in many cases.",
