        "For a rational prime number p, a \"p-practical number\" is a number m such that the polynomial x^m - 1 has a divisor of every degree <= m in F_p[x], the prime field of order p. See A336503, A336504 and A336505 for examples.",
        "A number m is lambda-practical if and only if every number 1 <= k <= m can be written as Sum_{d|m} lambda(d) * n_d, where lambda(d) = A002322(d) is the Carmichael lambda function, and 0 <= n_d <= phi(d)/lambda(d).",
        "A squarefree number is lambda-practical if and only if it is phi-practical (A260653). All phi-practical numbers are lambda-practical, but there are infinitely many lambda-practical numbers that are not phi-practical: 45, 135, 225, 405, 675, ... (A336507).",
        "If N(x) is the number of terms not exceeding, x then there are two positive constants c_1 and c_2 such that c_1 * x/log(x) <= N(x) <= c_2 * x/log(x) for all x >= 2."
