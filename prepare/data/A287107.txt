        "Let u=201, v=2101, w=20101 be the return words of the word 2.",
        "Under sigma u, v, and w are mapped to sigma(201) = 01012, sigma(2101) = 0121012, sigma(20101) = 010121012.",
        "All three images have suffix 2. We can therefore move this suffix to the front of all three images, obtaining the fixed point (a(n+1)) = 20101... when iterating. This induces the morphism 3 -> 5, 4 -> 34, 5 -> 54 on the return words, coded by their lengths.",
        "Coding the symbols according to 3<->2, 4<->1, 5<->0, this leads to the morphism 2->0, 1->21, 0->01 on the alphabet {0,1,2}. This is exactly the morphism which has A287072 as unique fixed point. So the sequence d of first differences of (a(n)) equals A287072 with the coding above. This gives the formula below.",
