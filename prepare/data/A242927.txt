        "k^3 + (k+1)^3 + (k+2)^3 = 3*(k+1)*(k^2+2*k+3) is never prime, therefore 3 is not a term of this sequence.",
        "Similarly, the corresponding expression for n = 4 and n = 5 is a multiple of 2 and 5, respectively, and for all n = 7, ..., 41, the expression also shares a factor with n (and thus is a multiple of n whenever n is prime).",
        "Index n = 110 is the smallest n > 42 for which the expression is not algebraically composite (the polynomial in k has content 1 and is irreducible over Q), but it does factor as (k(k+1)(k+2)(k+3)(k+4))^10 over Z_5, so is always a multiple of 5.) Index n = 210 is the next one which is a similar case.",
        "Index n = 231 is much like n = 110, but with a factor 7 instead of 5.",
        "Index n = 330 again yields an irreducible polynomial with content 1, but as before one can show that it is always divisible by 5. And so on."
