        "Let F(k) denote A049076(k). The list of primes p such that F(p) = n begins with q, the smallest prime to have prime index in each of n-1 successive primeth iterations, finally taking nonprime index 1 at the n-th iteration. All other members p such that F(p) = n are primes > q which also take a nonprime index at the n-th iteration. The reverse sequence of associated indices for q = prime(n) gives successive terms of the primeth recurrence 1,2,3,5,... until reaching A007097(prime(n)) = a(n)."
