        "The repeated pair is of the form (x,x+1) with 0 <= x <= n-1. Together with its repetition it occupies all but one position of the length-5 array. There are three choices for this position (beginning, middle, end; cf. example for n=1) and n+1 choices for the element in this position. This makes n*3*(n+1) forbidden arrays out of the (n+1)^5 possible ones. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 29 2020"
