        "Many of the comments following the \"Most Wanted Prime\" video assumed that A173426(1) was 11, and so \"Numbers k such that A173426(k) is prime\" should begin 1, 10, 2446, ... This is incorrect, A173426(1) = 1 and is not prime.",
        "However, if the 1 is omitted the sequence is too short to include in the OEIS, so the present sequence will serve as a place-holder until we find the next term.",
        "Its inclusion could also be justified by the OEIS policy of including published but erroneous sequences to serve as pointers to the correct versions.",
        "_Serge Batalov_ comments (see A173426) that a(4) >= 60000."
