        "This agrees with A052928 until n = 2436. a(2436) = 2434 and A052928(2436) = 2436. For n >= 2436 we have a(n) = n-2 for n even and a(n) = n - 1 for n odd, for an as yet undetermined number of n. A052928(n) = n - (n mod 2) for all n. See the paper by W. Clark and M. Shattuck linked to below."
