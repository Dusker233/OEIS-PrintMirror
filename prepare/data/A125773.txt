        "A068535 includes all powers of 2. a(3) = 1093 and a(7) = 3511 are the only known primes in this sequence. They belong to A001220 = Wieferich primes p: p^2 divides 2^(p-1) - 1. Note that most listed terms of this sequence are the multiples of Wieferich primes 1093 and 3511. No more terms in this sequence up to 6*10^6."
