        "A subset S of {0,1,2, ... n} is \"irreducible\" if it cannot be written as A + B = S for any A and B subsets of the integers with |A|, |B| >= 2. In this case, A + B is defined as the set of a + b for a in A and b in B.",

        "{0,1,2} is reducible since {0,1} + {0,1} = {0,1,2}. All other subsets of {0,1,2} are irreducible, so a(2) = 2. It is possible to reduce to the case of assuming every set contains only nonnegative integers and each set contains 0 by shifting the summand sets."
