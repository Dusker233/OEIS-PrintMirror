        "For 2 < n < 12, a(n) = A124059(n-1) (connected asymmetric graphs). This is because the singleton is the only asymmetric graph with fewer than 6 vertices, so in a disconnected asymmetric graph with fewer than 12 vertices one connected component must be the singleton, and it cannot occur more than once. - _Falk H\u00fcffner_, Jan 16 2020"
