        "For integers x,y,p,q >= 0, set (s_i)_{i>=1} to be the sequence of p ones followed by the binomial coefficients C(x,j) for 0 <= j <= x followed by an infinite string of zeros, and set (t_i)_{i>=1} to be the sequence of q ones followed by the binomial coefficients C(y,j) for 0 <= j <= y followed by an infinite string of zeros. Then a(n) is the number of non-unimodal sequences (r_i)_{i>=1} where r_i = Sum_{j=1..i} s_j*t_{i-j} for some(s_i) and (t_i) such that x + y + p + q + 1 = n.",
