        "The odd terms are easily understood: a(2m+1) = m^2.",
        "A straightforward (greedy) construction shows that m^2 skew-tetrominoes (all with the same orientation) can be packed into a (2m+1) X (2m) rectangle. Therefore a(2m+1) >= m^2.",
        "On the other hand, we also have a(2m+1) <= m^2: Consider all cells with indices of the form (2i, 2j); there are m^2 such cells in a (2m+1) X (2m+1) square. Moreover, any valid placement of a skew-tetromino must cover one of these cells, so a(2m+1) <= m^2.",
