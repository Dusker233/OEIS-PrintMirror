        "The above conjecture is true. Let m be even and let the m-th Bernoulli number be written in reduced form as Bernoulli(m) = N(m)/D(m). Apply Ireland and Rosen, Proposition 15.2.2, to show the congruence D(m)*( Sum_{k = 1..n} k^m )/n = N(m) (mod n) holds for all n >= 1. It follows easily from this congruence that ( Sum_{k = 1..n} k^m )/n is integral iff n is coprime to D(m). Now Bernoulli(4) = -1/(2*3*5) and Bernoulli(6) = 1/(2*3*7) so the numbers n such that both (Sum_{k=1..n} k^4) mod n = 0 and (Sum_{k=1..n} k^6) mod n = 0 are exactly those numbers coprime to the primes 2, 3, 5 and 7, that is, the 11-rough numbers.

        "The second Detlefs conjecture above is true and extremely easy to verify with some basic properties of congruences: take the terms of this sequence up to 209 and compute their sixth powers modulo 210: there should only be 1's and 169's there. Then take the complement of this sequence up to 210, where you will see no instances of 1 or 169. - _Alonso del Arte_, Jan 12 2014",
        "It is well-known that the product of 7 consecutive integers is divisible by 7!. Conjecture: This sequence is exactly the set of positive values of r such that ( Product_{k = 0..6} n + k*r )/7! is an integer for all n. - _Peter Bala_, Nov 14 2015",
        "From _Ruediger Jehn_, Nov 05 2020: (Start)",
        "This conjecture is true. The first part of the proof deals with numbers not in A008364, i.e., numbers which are divisible by p (p either 2, 3, 5, 7). Let r = p*s and n = 1, then (Product_{k = 0..6} n + k*r) is not divisible by p, because none of the factors 1 + k*p*s are divisible by p. Hence dividing the product by 7! does not return an integer.",
        "The second part deals with numbers in A008364. If r and q are coprime, then for any i < q there exists k < q with (k*r mod q) = i. From this, it also follows that for any n there exists k < q with ((n + k*r) mod q) = 0. But this means that Product_{k = 0..6} n + k*r is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 7 because there is always a factor that is divisible. We still have to show that the product is also divisible by 2 times 3 times 4 times 6. If the k_1 with ((n + k_1*r) mod 4) = 0 is even, then (n mod 2) = ((n + 2*r) mod 2) = ((n + 4*r) mod 2) = ((n + 6*r) mod 2) = 0. If this k_1 is odd, then ((n + r) mod 2) = ((n + 3*r) mod 2) = ((n + 5*r) mod 2) = 0. In both cases there are at least 2 other factors divisible by 2. If the k_2 with ((n + k_2*r) mod 6) = 0 is smaller than 4, then ((n + (k_2 + 3)*r) mod 3) = 0. Otherwise, ((n + (k_2 - 3)*r) mod 3) = 0. In both cases there is at least 1 other factor divisible by 3. And therefore Product_{k = 0..6} n + k*r is divisible by 7! for any n.",
