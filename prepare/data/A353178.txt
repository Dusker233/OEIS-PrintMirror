        "All positive tribonacci-like sequences are in the Trithoff array.",
        "Every tribonacci-like sequence s is a difference sequence of another tribonacci-like sequence t, where t is uniquely defined. If s is an integer sequence then, t doesn't have to be an integer sequence. If t is an integer sequence, then the row number corresponding to sequence s is in this sequence.",

        "The tribonacci sequence, the first row of the Trithoff array, is the difference sequence of the tribonacci-like sequence A000213 divided by 2. The result is not an integer sequence. Thus, 1 is not in this sequence."
