        "Any grid point with relative coordinates (x,y) from the central grid point, which is numbered 1, and where the greatest common divisor (gcd) of |x| and |y| equals 1 will be visible from the central point. Grid points where gcd(|x|,|y|) > 1 will have another point directly between it and the central point and will thus not be visible.",
