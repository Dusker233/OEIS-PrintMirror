    "comment": [
        "This uses the first definition of primitive abundant numbers, A071395: having only deficient proper divisors. The second definition (A091191: having no abundant proper divisors) would yield infinite a(3), since all numbers 6*p, p > 3, are in that sequence.",
        "See A287728 for the number of ODD primitive abundant numbers with n prime factors, counted with multiplicity and A295369 for the number of squarefree primitive abundant numbers with n distinct prime factors.",
        "It appears that a(n) is just slightly larger than A295369(n)."
