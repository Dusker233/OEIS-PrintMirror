    "comment": [
        "Orthoplex polyominoes are connected sets of cells of regular tilings with Schl\u00e4fli symbols {}, {4}, {3,4}, {3,3,4}, {3,3,3,4}, etc. These are tilings of regular orthoplexes projected on their circumspheres. Orthoplex polyominoes are equivalent to multidimensional polyominoes that do not extend more than two units along any axis, i.e., fit within a 2^d cube. This sequence is obtained using the first formula below. For oriented polyominoes, chiral pairs are counted as two."
