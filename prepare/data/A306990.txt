        "For a word w, cyc(w) refers to the set of all cyclic shifts of w. Thus cyc(ate) = {ate, tea, eat}.",
        "For a language (that is, a set of words), cyc(L) is the union of cyc(w) over all w in L.",
        "The deterministic state complexity of a regular language L is the smallest number of states needed by a deterministic finite automaton to accept L."
