        "The name of the number may contain other vowels (A, E, I, O or U) in any place and order. \"American English\" means that no \"and\" is used, e.g., 101 = \"one hundred one\".",
        "Therefore (and because 1000 = \"thousAnd\" is the least number using the letter \"A\"), for any term a(n) < 10^4, the number a(n) + x*10^4 is also in the sequence for any x > 0, and so is any number a(n)*10^(6k) + m, m < 10^(6k), k > 0. (The statement isn't true with x*10^3: for example 1084 + 999000 does not have the letter \"A\".)",
        "In French, 92 (\"quAtrE-vIngt dOUze\") has the property, and as a consequence the corresponding sequence consists mainly of 92 + x*100 with any x >= 0, and 472 + x*1000 with any x >= 0 (\"quAtrE cent soIxante-dOUze\"; there is no other term below 4000, from where on others (4012, 4061, 4062, ...) come into play.",
        "In German, the first number to have an 'o' is \"Million\". Since the 'I' must be preceded by 'A' and 'E', the corresponding sequence would start only after 18*10^6: 18000005, 18000009, 18000015, 18000019, 18000021, 18000022, ..."
