        "No closed form formula is known for a(n), but the values can be determined by an induction algorithm. Let X_(n-1) be the set of KMPLE support values associated with n-1 items on test. Let |X_(n-1)| be the cardinality of X_(n-1). The set of KMPLE support values associated with n items in test is the union of X_(n-1) and the set consisting of the elements of X_(n-1) multiplied by (1- 1/n) = (n-1)/n.",
