        "The average number of matches of length \"n\" digits is exactly 0.9. That is, we expect 0.9 matches with 1 digit, 0.9 matches with 2 digits, etc. Increasing the number of digits by a factor of 10 means that we expect to find 0.9 new matches. Increasing the search from 10^11 to 10^12 (which includes 10 times as much work) would thus only expect to find 0.9 new matches. - _Alan Eliasen_, May 01 2013 (corrected by _Michael Beight_, Mar 21 2020)",
