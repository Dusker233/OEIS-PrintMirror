    "comment": [
        "This sequence gives the number of self-avoiding walks on a 2-dimensional square lattice where the walk starts with a step length of 1 which then increments by 1 after each step up until the step length is n.",
        "The first time a collision with a previous step can occur is for n = 6. This can occur in three different ways. For example a walk with steps of length 1,2 and 3 to the right, a step of length 4 upward, then a step of length 5 to the left. A step of length 6 downward would now result in a collision. Requiring six steps before a collision is in contrast to the standard 2D square lattice SAW of A001411 where a collision can occur on the fourth step.",
        "Note that this sequence agrees with a SAW on the diamond lattice, A001394, for the first 7 terms, even though the seventh term here has some walks removed due to the above collision."
