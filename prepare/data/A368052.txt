        "Let s(0), s(1), s(2), s(3) be the 4 initial values in a Somos-4 sequence. The following terms s(4), s(5), ... are rational expressions in the 4 initial values derived from the Somos-4 recurrence: s(n) = ( s(n-1)*s(n-3) + s(n-2)^2 ) / s(n-4). E.g., s(4) = (s(1)*s(3) + s(2)^2) / s(0), s(5) = (s(0)*s(3)^2 + s(1)*s(2)*s(3) + s(2)^3) / (s(0)*s(1)), s(6) = ... .",

The involutions generate an infinite dihedral group. Already 2 consecutive involutions S(n), S(n+1) generate this group too. This group as a dihedral group has 2 conjugacy classes { ..., S(0), S(2), S(4), ... } and { ..., S(1), S(3), S(5), ... } of involutions. The degree of such an involution S(n) equals the degree of G(n+3) and the term a(n+3) in the actual sequence."
