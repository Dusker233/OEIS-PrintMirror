        "The probability that a totient number starts with an initial 1 does not obey Benford's law however it does appear to tend to a constant value. In a sample of 10^9 totient numbers the distribution of initial digits 1 - 9 is approx. 21.595%, 20.774%, 16.457%, 12.682%, 7.904%, 6.633%, 5.505%, 4.634%, 3.816%."
