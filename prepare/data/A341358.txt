    "comment": [
        "These numbers are quite close to being abundant.",
        "Note that if k is a perfect number, then k*m is abundant for all m > 1. For deficient k we cannot expect this to happen since k*p must be deficient for all primes p that are large enough. However, it seems that the smallest p making k*p deficient is big compared with k. For example, the smallest prime p such that 315*p is deficient is p = 107, and the smallest prime p such that 884*p is deficient is p = 443.",
        "It's actually possible that a multiple of a term (other than the term itself) is again in this sequence. However, it seems that this rarely happens. For example, both 1329548 and 1329548 * 16619 are terms."
