        "If a number (a product of exactly three primes) has an odd number of digits, only its central digit is deleted to test for status as a cube; if such a number has an even number of digits, its two central digits are deleted to test whether that's a cube. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Dec 19 2020",
        "In theory, a cube with an even number of digits could be represented in the sequence by up to 110 numbers by inserting {0,1,...,9} and {00,01,...,99}. In the first 10000 terms, 1079^3 has a record 46 representatives, though it is unlikely that this is a global record.",
        "The cubes of 10, 20 and 48 are the first three cubes not represented in the sequence.",
