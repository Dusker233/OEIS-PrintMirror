        "The sequence is the number of unique arrangements of directed graphs connecting 2*n vertices, where vertices occur in pairs, and meeting the following requirements:",
        "1. Each vertex has an out-degree and in-degree of 1.",
        "2. No edge connects vertices that are paired.",
        "3. Starting with any pair, following the edges of paired vertices connects all vertices.",
        "4. There are no closed walks of two vertices (i.e., no reciprocal connections).",
        "The requirements were chosen to yield a nice gift exchange between a set of couples. Acknowledgement to the additional members of the initial, inspirational gift exchange group: Cat, Brad, Kim, Ada, Graham, Nolan, and Leah.",
        "The fraction of graphs meeting the requirements is approximately 0.07. Starting with n=2, the fractions are (0.083333333, 0.066666667, 0.06547619, 0.068994709, 0.071212121, 0.072810787). Is there a way to compute the percentage of graphs satisfying the condition in the limit as n approaches infinity?"
