    "comment": [
        "The relatively prime condition arises naturally from the perspective of Egyptian fractions representations of unity which in turn arise upon dividing the elements of such a subset all by n. In particular the condition guarantees that the Egyptian fraction representation of unity doesn't arise already from any smaller n."
