        "Let's iteratively apply the summation of two consecutive terms to A000292. It generates A000330, then A005900, then A001845, then A008412, then this sequence. Every sequence in this series starts with 1 followed by the sum of 1 and the next term in the previous sequence; because of that, for A008412 and this sequence, the initial term(s) are exceptions from the general formula.",
