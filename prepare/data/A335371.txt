        "If m is a harmonic number (A001599), then it is possible to generate a new harmonic number m*p if p is a prime number that does not divide m and (p+1)/2 is a divisor of the harmonic mean of the divisors of m, h(m) = m * tau(m)/sigma(m) = m * A000005(m)/A000203(m).",

In the second iteration, a new set of harmonic number is being generated from each of the harmonic numbers from the previous iteration, a union of these sets is be calculated (removing duplicates). The process is terminated when no more harmonic numbers can be generated. The total number of harmonic numbers from all the iterations is being counted. The terms of this sequence have a record count of new harmonic numbers.",
