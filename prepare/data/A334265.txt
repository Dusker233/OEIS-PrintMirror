        "Reversed Lyndon words are different from co-Lyndon words (A326774).",
        "A Lyndon word is a finite sequence of positive integers that is lexicographically strictly less than all of its cyclic rotations.",
        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions."
