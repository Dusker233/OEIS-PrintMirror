        "The only composite n in A024619 for which n < A096014(n) is 6. Let n be a composite that is not a prime power (i.e., in A024619), let p = lpf(n) = A020639(n), and let q = A053669(n) be the smallest prime that does not divide n. We observe that A096014(n) = A020639(n) * A053669(n) = pq. Such n with n < pq must minimize one factor while maximizing the other. The prime p is minimum when n is even, and q is greatest when n is the product p_k# of the smallest k primes, i.e., when n is in A002110. Alternatively, q is minimum when n is odd, however, n > 2p since n is the product of at least two distinct odd primes. Since p_k# greatly increases as k increments, while A053669(p_k#) = p_(k + 1), and observing that A096014(30) = 2 * 7 = 14, the only composite n in A024619 such that n < pq is 6."
