        "This sequence is a primitive sequence related to A365406 in the sense that it can be used to find the smallest term k in A365406 such that tau(k), omega(k) or bigomega(k) has some particular value.",
        "Not every prime signature produces a term. For example no term has prime signature (3, 2, 1). Proof: any number with prime signature (3, 2, 1) has 24 divisors. Hence the 12th divisor must be a power of 2. But the largest power of 2 such number can have as a divisor is 8. 8 can never be the 12th divisor of a number. Therefore (3, 2, 1) can never be the prime signature of a term."

    "example": [
        "k = 20 = 2^2 * 5 is in the sequence as it has prime signature (2, 1) and its largest divisor <= sqrt(k) is 4, a power of 2. It is the smallest such number since smaller numbers with prime signature (2, 1), namely 12 and 18, do not have the relevant divisor being a power of 2."
