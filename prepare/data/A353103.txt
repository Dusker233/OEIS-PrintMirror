        "Start with an n X n square grid. Each cell has neighbors horizontally and vertically. Place the numbers 1 and 2 anywhere. Now place the numbers 3, 4, ..., m in order, subject to the rule that when you place k, the sum of the numbers that a Chess Rook attack in the same row and column must equal k. Then a(n) is the maximum m that can be achieved."
