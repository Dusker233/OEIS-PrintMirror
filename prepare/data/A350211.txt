        "A heuristic argument suggests that this short list is complete. By Stirling's approximation, n! has order n*log(n) digits of which n/4 are terminal zeros. If the remaining digits are random, the mean will be just below 4.5. For n > 6, n! and also its digits sum are divisible by 9. 12! is the only factorial with 9 digits. The others have 27, 30, 36, 81, 522, 846, 1224, and 1350 digits, respectively."
