        "We define a composition to be alternating including twins (x,x) if there are no adjacent triples (..., x, y, z, ...) where x <= y <= z or x >= y >= z. Except in the case of twins (x,x), all such compositions are anti-runs (A003242). These compositions avoid the weak consecutive patterns (1,2,3) and (3,2,1), the strict version being A344614.",
