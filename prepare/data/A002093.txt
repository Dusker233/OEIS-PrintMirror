        "Conjecture: (a) Every highly abundant number > 10 is practical (A005153). (b) For every integer k there exists A such that k divides a(n) for all n > A. Daniel Fischer proved that every highly abundant number greater than 3, 20, 630 is divisible by 2, 6, 12 respectively. The first conjecture has been verified for the first 10000 terms. - _Jaycob Coleman_, Oct 16 2013",
        "Conjecture: For each term k: (1) Let p be the largest prime less than k (if one exists) and let q be the smallest prime greater than k; then k-p is either 1 or a prime, and q-k is either 1 or a prime. (2) The closest prime number p < k located to a distance d = k-p > 1 is also always at a prime distance. These would mean that the even highly abundant numbers greater than 2 always have at least a Goldbach pair of primes. h=p+d. Both observations verified for the first 10000 terms. - _David Morales Marciel_, Jan 04 2016",
        "Pillai used the term \"highly abundant numbers of the r-th order\" for numbers with record values of the sum of the reciprocals of the r-th powers of their divisors. Thus highly abundant numbers of the 1st order are actually the superabundant numbers (A004394). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 30 2019"
