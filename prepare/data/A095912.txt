        "Example: there are 5 payphones. First arrival may choose any; he selects phone #2. Next arrival must take the furthest away, #5. Next arrival must take either of #3 or #4 (since both have a neighbor on one side and a vacant slot on the other); he chooses #3. Next arrival must take #1 (because end slots are preferred over \"sandwiched\" slots), leaving #4 for the last arrival. The permutation (25314) is one of a(5)=10 that satisfy the requirements."
