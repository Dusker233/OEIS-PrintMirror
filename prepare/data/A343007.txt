        "Define L(n) to be the n-th partial sum of the Leibniz formula Pi = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + ..., i.e., L(n) = Sum_{j=1..n} 4*(-1)^(j+1)/(2*j-1). For every positive integer n, L(n+1) is closer to Pi than L(n) is. If we let V be the average of the two consecutive partial sums L(n) and L(n+1), then the partial sums that lie closest to V are L(a(n)-1) and L(a(n)+1) (one of which is above V, the other below)."
