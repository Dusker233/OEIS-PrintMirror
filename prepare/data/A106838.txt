        "Number points of the Heighway/Harter dragon curve starting m=0 at the origin.  Those m with odd part 4k+3 (A091067) are where the curve turns right.  So this sequence is the first m of each run of 3 consecutive right turns.  There are no runs of 4 or more since the turn at odd m alternates left and right.  Bates, Bunder, and Tognetti (Theorem 19, page 104), show the last of each run is integers of the form 2^p*(4k+3) with p>=3.  So here the first of each run is a(n) = 8*A091067(n)-2 as Ralf Stephan already noted. - _Kevin Ryde_, Mar 12 2020"
