        "Sequence gives the number of edge-to-edge regular-polygon tilings having n vertex classes relative to the symmetry of the tiling. Allows tilings with two or more vertex classes having the same arrangement of surrounding polygons (vertex type), as long as those classes are distinct within the symmetry of the tiling .",
        "There are eleven 1-uniform tilings (also called the \"Archimedean\" tessellations) which comprise the three regular tessellations (all triangles, squares, or hexagons) plus the eight semiregular tessellations."
