        "Take n occurrences of x with exponentiation operators ^ between them and parenthesize them in all possible ways. Consider these expressions as functions on [0, 1], and remove duplicate functions. The number of remaining distinct functions are given by A000081. Now, integrate each function over [0, 1], find the average value of the results, and count the results that are above the average. This number gives a(n). Thus, a(n) < A000081(n)."
