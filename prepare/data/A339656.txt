        "An integer partition is loop-graphical if it comprises the multiset of vertex-degrees of some graph with loops, where a loop is an edge with two equal vertices. See A339658 for the Heinz numbers, and A339655 for the complement.",
        "The following are equivalent characteristics for any positive integer n:",
        "(1) the multiset of prime factors of n can be partitioned into distinct pairs, i.e., into a set of edges and loops;",
        "(2) n can be factored into distinct semiprimes;",
        "(3) the unordered prime signature of n is loop-graphical."
