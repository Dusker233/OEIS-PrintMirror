    "comment": [
        "Heuberger and Wagner consider how many different maximum matchings a tree of n vertices may have.  They determine the unique tree (free tree) of n vertices with the largest number of maximum matchings, or at n=6 and n=34 the two trees with equal largest number.  a(n) is the matching number of the unique tree, and of both n=34 trees since they have the same matching number.  For n=6, a(6)=1 is the star-6 which is their T_{6,1}.  The other n=6 is their T_{6,2} and its matching number would be a(6)=2 instead.",
        "The trees n!=2 have all pairs of leaves an even distance apart (the type of free tree counted by A304867).  Vertices an even distance to a leaf are Heuberger and Wagner's type A, and vertices an odd distance to a leaf are type B.  Per their definitions (and for any \"even distance leaves\" tree in fact), all type B vertices must be matched in a maximum matching and consequently the matching number is the number of type B vertices.  2n/7 appears in the formula below since each \"C\" part contains 7 vertices of which 2 are type B; then there are certain fixed additional B vertices according to n mod 7."
