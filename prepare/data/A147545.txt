        "This sequence starts like A074781 but grows much faster. Observe that there can be large differences between consecutive terms. Can it be shown that there is always such a prime between consecutive powers of 2? Or that this sequence is infinite? By theorem 1 of the Noe paper, this sequence is a subsequence of A135832, primes in Section I of the phi iteration.",

        "All terms with binary weight k (A000120, at least 2 for these terms) can be found as a subset of primes found on the row k-1 of array A334100. E.g. primes with weight 2 are Fermat primes (A019434), those with weight 3 are A334092 (which doesn't contain any other primes), those with weight 4 are in A334093 (among also other kind of primes), those with weights 5, 6, 7 are included as (proper) subsets in A334094, A334095 and A334096 respectively.
