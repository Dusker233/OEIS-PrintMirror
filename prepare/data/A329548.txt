        "Consider the arrangement made of all lines with equations x=log(integer), y=log(integer), and x+y=log(integer). Let's call the \"n-th stripe\" that portion of the first quadrant between the lines x+y=log(n) and x+y=log(n+1). The n-th stripe contains 2*n-1 regions (triangles, trapezoids and parallelograms), many of which may be isometric. We can consider that isometric regions are of the same type. By definition, a(n) is the number of distinct types of regions in the n-th stripe."
