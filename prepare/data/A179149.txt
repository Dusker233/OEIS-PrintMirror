        "Contains all sixth powers: suppose that y^2 = x^3 + t^6, then (y/t^3)^2 = (x/t^2)^3 + 1. The elliptic curve Y^2 = X^3 + 1 has rank 0 and the only rational points on it are (-1,0), (0,+-1), and (2,+-3), so y^2 = x^3 + t^6 has 5 solutions (-t^2,0), (0,+-t^3), and (2*t^2,+-3*t^3). - _Jianing Song_, Aug 24 2022"
