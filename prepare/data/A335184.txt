        "For n >= 6 the sequence contains the triangular numbers; for n >= 12 we have to add the tetrahedral numbers; for n >= 18 we have to add the numbers binomial(n,4) (starting with 0,1,5,...); for n >= 24 we have to add the numbers binomial(n,5) (starting with 0,1,6,..); in general, for n >= 6*k we have to add to the sequence the numbers binomial(n, k+1), k >= 1.",
        "For example, a(26) = 1106 = 210+560+330+6, where 210 is a triangular number, 560 is a tetrahedral number, 330 is a number binomial(n,4) and 6 is a number binomial(m,5) (with the proper n, m due to shifts in names of the sequences).",
