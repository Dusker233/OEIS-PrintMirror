        "The magnitude of the smallest prime required in a Goldbach partition of 2n is very small in comparison to the magnitude of the sum, 2n."

    "example": [
        "The first three partitions with the smallest first member are (3,3), (3,5), and (3,7), so the smallest prime required to generate all Goldbach partitions up through 10^1 is 3."
