        "All terms are odd.",
        "All terms are congruent to 3 modulo 4 after the first term. Proof: define sin(x)/x to be 1 at x = 0. If a(n) == 1 (mod 4), then the horizontal line y = 1/n is tangent to the curve y = sin(x)/x at (x_n, sin(x_n)/x_n) for some x_n >= 0. We have tan(x_n) = x_n and sin(x_n)/x_n = 1/n, so cos(x_n) = 1/n. By the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, we have either x_n = 0 or x_n must be transcendental (if x is a nonzero algebraic number, then exp(x) is transcendental). On the other hand, x_n = tan(x_n) = sqrt(n^2-1) is algebraic, so the only possibility is n = 1. - _Jianing Song_, Jul 13 2021"
