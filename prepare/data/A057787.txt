        "Draw a quarter circle with radius one, centered at the corner of a unit square. It divides the square into two pieces. Call these pieces monarcs. Polyarcs are the figures created by joining monarcs edge-to-edge. - _Henri Picciotto_, Jan 04 2015",
        "Henri Picciotto invented and named the polyarcs in the late 1980\u2019s. They were first published in World Games Review, Michael Keller\u2019s zine. Brendan Owen found and counted the polyarcs to n = 9. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 29 2015",
        "When a complete square is present, the internal details of the division (which can happen in four ways) are ignored for the purposes of this sequence. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jul 04 2022"
