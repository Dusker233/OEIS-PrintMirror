        "A number b is a term if 1+b+b^2 can be multiplied by a number k < b to obtain a cube. The smallest candidate k can be easily obtained from the prime factorization of 1+b+b^2. For example, for b = 761357755 we have 1+b+b^2 = 3 * 7^2 * 2131 * 12277^3, so k = 3^2 * 7 * 2131^2, which happens to smaller than b.  a(7) > 10^10. - _Giovanni Resta_, Sep 02 2019"
