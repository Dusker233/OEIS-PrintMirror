        "If Q is a perfect number such that gcd(Q, 3(3^a(n) + 2)) = 1, then x = 3^(a(n) - 1)*(3^a(n) + 2)*Q is a solution of the equation sigma(x) = 3(x - Q). This is a result of the following theorem:",
        "Theorem: If Q is a (q-1)-perfect number for some prime q, then for all integers t, the equation sigma(x) = q*x - (2t+1)*Q has the solution x = q^(k-1)*p*Q whenever k is a positive integer such that p = q^k + 2t is prime, gcd(q^(k-1), p) = 1 and gcd(q^(k-1)*p,Q) = 1.",
        "Note that by taking t = -1/2(m*q+1), this theorem gives us some solutions of the equation sigma(x) = q *(x + m*Q). See comment lines of the sequence A058959. (End)",
