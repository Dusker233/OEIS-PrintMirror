    "comment": [
        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions."

        "Composition 2362 in standard order is (3,3,1,1,2,2), with run-lengths (2,2,2), so 2362 is in the sequence."
