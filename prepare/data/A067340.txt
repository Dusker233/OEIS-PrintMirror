        "If the name means 'Numbers k such that (number of prime factors of k) is divisible by the (number of distinct prime factors of k)', then 1 has to be prepended to the data since A001221(1) = A001222(1) = 0 and 0 is divisible by 0.",
        "Note that the expression 'A001222(k)/A001221(k)' is read as 'the quotient of A001222(k) and A001221(k)' and is not defined in the case k = 1 because A001221(1) = 0. On the other hand, the expression 'A001221(k) | A001222(k)' is read as 'A001221(k) divides A001222(k)' and is well defined also if k = 1 and has the value 'True'. (End)"
