        "The infinum for a(n)/A007018(n) is achieved on the problem maximize Sum_{j=1..n} x_j/A007018(j-1), subject to Sum_{j=1..n} x_j/(A007018(j-1)+mu_n) <= 1, where 0 <= mu_n < 1 and Sum_{j=1..n} 1/(A007018(j-1) + mu_n) = 1.

The optimal solution vector to this problem is (1,1,...,1) and the optimal solution value is a(n+1)/A007018(n+1), whereas the approximate solution vectors are (1,0,0,...,0), (0,A007018(1),0,...,0), (0,0,A007018(2),...,0), ..., (0,0,0,...,A007018(n-1)) and the corresponding value of the objective function is 1."
