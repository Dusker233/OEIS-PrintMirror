        "In a permutation of [n] that contains the shuffle pattern s-k-t, where s = 12 and t = 132, k should be greater than the numbers in pattern s and the numbers in pattern t. (The numbers in each of the patterns s and t should be contiguous.) Clearly, for n = 0..5, all permutations of [n] avoid this shuffle pattern (since we need at least six numbers to get this pattern). Hence, a(n) = n! for n = 0..5.",
        "For n = 6, k should be equal to 6, and for the pattern s = 12 we have the 10 choices 12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 24, 25, 34, 35, and 45. The corresponding permutations of [6] that contain this shuffle pattern are 126354, 136254, 146253, 156243, 236154, 246153, 256143, 346152, 356142, and 456132. Thus, a(6) = 6! - 10 = 710. (End)"
