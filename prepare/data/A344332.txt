        "This sequence is relative to the generalization of the 4th problem proposed for the pupils in grade 6 during the 19th Mathematical Festival at Moscow in 2008 (see A344330).",
        "There are two types of solutions, the second one is proposed here, while type 1 is described in A344331.",
        "If m is a term and k > 1, k * m is another term.",
        "Every term (primitive or not primitive) is the side of an elementary square of type 2 (see A346263).",
        "Some notations: s = side of the tiled square, a = side of small squares, b = side of large squares, and z = number of small squares = number of large squares.",
        "-> Primitive squares",
        "Side s of primitive squares of type 2 must satisfy the Diophantine equation s^2 = z * (a^2+b^2) with the conditions a^2+b^2 = c^2 and gcd(a, b, c) = 1.",
        "In this case, q = a/(c-b) must be odd, and side s = q*c = a*c/(c-b) = (a+b)*c/a with a number of squares z = q^2 = (a/(c-b))^2 = ((b+c)/a)^2.",
        "Indeed, these conditions give exactly the following solutions for n >= 2: s = n^4-(n-1)^4 (A005917), a = 2*n-1 (A005408), b = 2*n*(n-1) (A046092), c = 2*n*(n-1)+1 (A001844), z = (2*n-1)^2 (A016754); this results come from the identity:",

        "For n >= 2, every primitive square is composed by a square S1 of z = (2*n-1)^2 large squares with side b = 2*n*(n-1), then an edge on two sides of this square S1 of z = (2*n-1)^2 small squares with side a = 2*n-1.",
        "See example with design of square of side s = 15 with a = 3, b = 4, c = 5, q = 3, z = 9, obtained with n= 2.",
        "-> Non-primitive squares",
        "If s is the side of a primitive square of type 2, then every k * s, k > 1 is a non-primitive term that gives two distinct tilings of type 2.",
        "The square ks X ks can be tiled with z = q^2 = (2n-1)^2 = (a/(c-b))^2 = ((b+c)/a)^2 squares of side ka and of side kb, but also,",
        "The square ks X ks can be tiled with z = k^2*q^2 = ((2n-1)*k)^2 = (k*a/(c-b))^2 = (k*(b+c)/a)^2 squares of side a and of side b (see example)."
