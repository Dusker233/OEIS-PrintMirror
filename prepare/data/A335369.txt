        "If k is a harmonic number (A001599) and p is a prime that does not divide k, then k*p is a harmonic number if and only if (p+1)/2 is a divisor of the harmonic mean of the divisors of k, h(k) = k*tau(k)/sigma(k) = k*A000005(k)/A000203(k). The terms of this sequence are harmonic numbers k such that for all the divisors d of h(k), 2*d - 1 is either a nonprime or a prime divisor of k.",

Therefore, they are in this sequence if p = 2 or if 2*p - 1 is composite (i.e., not in A172461). Of the first 47 Mersenne exponents there are 37 such primes (p = 2, 5, 13, 17, ...), with the corresponding even perfect numbers 6, 496, 33550336, 8589869056, ..."
