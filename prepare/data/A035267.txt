        "A positive integer k belongs to the sequence if and only if k (modulo 37) is a term of A010398 and, moreover, in the case that prime factors p of k are terms of A038914, they occur only with even exponents. Or, more briefly, any positive integer is a term of this sequence if none of its divisors is an odd power of primes from A038914. For these primes also p (modulo 37) = {2, 5, 6, 8, 13, ...} = A028750 applies. - _Klaus Purath_, May 12 2023"
