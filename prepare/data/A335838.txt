        "We define a (normal) pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670 and ranked by A333217. A sequence S is said to contiguously match a pattern P if there is a contiguous subsequence of S whose parts have the same relative order as P. For example, (3,1,1,3) contiguously matches (1,1,2) and (2,1,1) but not (2,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), or (2,2,1)."
