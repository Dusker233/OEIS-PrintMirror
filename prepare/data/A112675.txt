        "This sequence counts paths in a triangular region of the familiar 2-dimensional lattice in which each point has 6 neighbors (sometimes called either the \"triangular\" or the \"hexagonal\" lattice), visiting every vertex of the region exactly once. The paths are not assumed to be closed. A path and its reversal are not considered equivalent."
