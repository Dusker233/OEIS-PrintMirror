    "comment": [
        "Consider a binary tree evolving in time from a single node until the tree has 2n labeled leaves. Color the 2n leaves in 2 colors, red and blue, assigning n leaves to each color. Suppose coalescences of pairs of leaves happen at distinct times (i.e., no simultaneous mergers). A coalescence sequence is a sequence of coalescence events backward in time, tracing the reduction of the 2n leaves to the single ancestral node. A paraphyletic coalescence sequence is a sequence in which (1) all n red leaves have a common ancestor node that is not the ancestor of any blue leaves; or (2) all n blue leaves have a common ancestor node that is not the ancestor of any red leaves; but not both (1) and (2)."
