        "It appears that sequence terms are more scarce than prime numbers. The number of terms in this sequence (n) and the number of prime numbers up to a(n) are shown in the figure attached in the LINKS section. It can be seen that, for a(n) > 304, n is less than pi(a(n)), where pi is the prime counting function."
