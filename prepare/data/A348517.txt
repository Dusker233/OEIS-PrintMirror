        "The idea for this sequence comes from the French website Diophante (see link) where these numbers are called \u201ctetraphile\u201d or \u201c4-phile\u201d. A number that is not tetraphile is called \"tetraphobe\" or \"4-phobe\".",

        "The smallest tetraphile number is 15 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 and the largest tetraphobe is 48, so this sequence is infinite since every integer >= 49 is a term.",
        "If m is tetraphile, q* m, q > 1, is another tetraphile number.",
