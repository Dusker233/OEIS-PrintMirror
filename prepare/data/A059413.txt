        "a(n) is also the number of permutations of [n+1] realized by the binary shift. The binary shift is the operation (w_1,w_2,w_3,...) -> (w_2,w_3,...) on infinite binary words. The relative order (lexicographically) of the first k shifts of a word, assuming they are all different, determines a realized permutation of length k. [_Sergi Elizalde_, Jun 23 2011]",
