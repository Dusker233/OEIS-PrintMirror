        "Integers with at least one 0 digit cannot be terms. There is no other palindrome after 999999999, but is the sequence complete? The non-palindromic numbers in the sequence are 864, 362436, 18181818, 26666664, 36484836, 48363648 and 1666516665, in which zero, seven and nine do not appear as a digit. These non-palindromes are multiples of 3 and have a multiple of 6 as the sum of their digits.",
        "The sequence is finite because the sum of the reciprocals of the digits of every zeroless number greater than 10^81-1 exceeds 9, while the ratio R(n)/n is always smaller than 9. a(43) > 10^13, if it exists. - _Giovanni Resta_, Aug 12 2019"
