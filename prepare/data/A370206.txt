        "Each term has 4 odd divisors and has the form 2^k * p * q, k > 0, p and q prime,  2 < p < 2^(k+1) <  2^(k+1) * p < q. The inequalities ensure that the four 1's in row a(n) of triangle in A237048 are in positions 1, p, 2^(k+1), and 2^(k+1) * p <= floor( (sqrt(8*a(n)+1) - 1)/2 ) < q and establish width pattern 1210 in SRS(a(n)) up to the diagonal. Also since p < 2^(k+1), numbers of the form 2^k * p^3 force p^2 < 2^(k+1) * p which creates a width pattern of the form 1212121.",
        "When a(n) satisfies q = 2^(k+1) * p + 1 it is the smallest number with prime factor p  whose two parts of SRS(a(n)) meet at the diagonal since in this case 2^(k+1) * p = floor( (sqrt(8*a(n)+1) - 1)/2 ). The first 4 numbers with p = 3 are  2* 3 * 13 = 78, 2^4 * 3 * 97 = 4656, 2^5 * 3 * 193 = 18528 and 2^7 * 3 * 769 = 295296. The smallest number with prime factor p = 47 has 355 digits.",
