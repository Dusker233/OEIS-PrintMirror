        "The Hausdorff metric defines a distance between sets. Using this distance we can define line segments with sets as endpoints. Create two sets from the vertices of the parts A and B (with |A| = 6) of a complete bipartite graph K(6,n) (with n at least 3) missing two edges, where the removed edges are incident to the same point in A. Points in the sets A and B that correspond to vertices that are connected by edges are the same Euclidean distance apart. This sequence tells the number of sets at each location on the line segment between A and B.",
