        "Let m be a superabundant number. Since m is a product of primorials P, we may identify a greatest primorial divisor P(omega(m)) = A002110(A001221(A004394(n))).",
        "This sequence lists the primitive quotients k = m/P(omega(m)).",
        "Since m is a product of primorials and k is the quotient resulting from division of m by the largest primorial divisor P, this sequence is also a subset of A025487, which in turn is a subset of A055932.",
        "We can plot all m in A004394 at (A002110(j),k), but this sequence does not accommodate all highly composite numbers; it is missing k = {36, 96, 216, 480, ...}. In contrast, k in A301414 can represent all superabundant numbers m, but a(116)=592424239959167616000 is the least k missing. Therefore in order to plot both A002182 and A004394 one must use the union of a(n) and A301414(n). One can ably plot all the terms common to both A002182 and A004394 (i.e., A166981) using k in A301414."
