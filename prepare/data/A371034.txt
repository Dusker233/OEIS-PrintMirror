The inequalities ensure that the six 1's in row a(n) of triangle in A237048 are in positions 1, p, 2^(k+1), 2^(k+1) * p, q and p*q <= floor( (sqrt(8*a(n)+1) - 1)/2 ) < 2^(k+1) * q and establish width pattern 121012 in SRS(a(n)) up to the diagonal. Also, since p < 2^(k+1), numbers of the form 2^k * p^2 * q with 2 < p < q force p^2 < 2^(k+1) * p which creates width patterns of the form 1212 ... ."
