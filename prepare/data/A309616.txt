        "It appears that a(n) is the number of decibinary numbers that can be constructed to represent the decimal numbers 2n-2 and 2n-1. To make this more clear let's consider n = 5: a(5) = 10 means that there are 10 decibinary numbers that represent the decimal numbers 2*5 - 2 = 8 and 2*5 - 1 = 9.",

At the moment the 10th binary partition function is not in OEIS. However, my experiments strongly suggest that the 10th binary partition function would indeed look like 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6, 10, 10, 13, 13, ..."
