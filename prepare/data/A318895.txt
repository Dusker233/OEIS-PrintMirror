        "The concept of isoclinism was introduced in Hall (1940) and is crucial to enumerating the groups of order p^n where p is a prime.",
        "An isoclinism exists between two groups G1 and G2 if the following holds: There is an isomorphism f between their two inner automorphism groups G1/Z(G1) and G2/Z(G2). There is an isomorphism h between their two commutator groups [G1, G1] and [G2, G2]. Lastly, f and h commute with F1 and F2, where F1 is the mapping from G1/Z(G1) x G1/Z(G1) to [G1, G1], given by a, b -> ab(a^-1)(b^-1), and F2 is defined analogously."
