        "Apparently, all known terms (checked through 10^18) are squares with maximum exponent 2, i.e., terms of A111245 (squares that are not a higher power). This would imply that of 3 immediately adjacent perfect powers, at least one is a term of A111245. Is there a known counterexample of 3 consecutive perfect powers, none of which is in A111245?"
