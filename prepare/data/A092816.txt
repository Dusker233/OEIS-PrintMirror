        "Hardy-Littlewood conjecture: Number of Sophie Germain primes less than n ~ 2*C2*n/(log(n))^2, where C2 = 0.6601618158... is the twin prime constant (see A005597). The truth of the above conjecture would imply that there are an infinite number of Sophie Germain primes (which is also conjectured). - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jan 31 2013"

        "For any n, a(n) = qcc(x) - (10^n - pi(10^n) - pi(2 * 10^n + 1) + 1) where qcc(x) is the number of \"common composite numbers\" c <= 10^n such that both c and c' = 2*c + 1 are composite (trivial). - _Sergey Pavlov_, Apr 08 2021"
