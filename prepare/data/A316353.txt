    "comment": [
        "This sequence itself is not a semigroup, but the set of all the partitions enumerated by this sequence does form a semigroup (actually a subsemigroup of the set of all partitions) with the following binary operation: let alpha = the partition (a,b,c,... [this is of course a finite list]) be the partition of the number N1 [that is, a + b + c + ... = N1] and let ALPHA = (A,B,C,...) be the partition of N2. Then the binary operation given by alpha*ALPHA = (a,b,c,...)*(A,B,C,...) = (aA,aB,aC,...,bA,bB,bC,...,cA,cB,cC,...) is a partition of the integer N1*N2. Furthermore, since any part x of alpha is less than the square root of N1, and likewise for any part Y of ALPHA, then the part xY is less than the square root of N1*N2, so the set is a subsemigroup of the semigroup of all partitions under the given operation. If the sole partition (1) of 1 is adjoined, the semigroup becomes a monoid."
