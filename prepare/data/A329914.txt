        "The idea of this sequence comes from the 21-digit integer 112359550561797732809 in Penguin dictionary (see reference) with this property: \"The smallest number which, when 1 is placed at both ends, the number is multiplied by 99\". The terms of this sequence are the other numbers k that have the same property than 99 and the corresponding smallest numbers M in each set {M_k} are in A329915 (see link).",
        "The Diophantine equation to solve is 1M1 = k * M  with M that has q digits, this is equivalent to 10^(q+1) + 1 = (k-10) * M, with number of zeros in 10^(q+1) + 1 = q also.",
        "Some results coming from this Diophantine equation:",
        "q >= 2 and 21 <= k <= 110, so this sequence is finite. The integers (k-10) end with 1, 3, 7 or 9, hence k also.",
        "Integer (k-10) must be a divisor of 10^(q+1)+1 = A000533(q+1).",
        "For k = 21, there is 21 * 91 = 1[91]1 but also 21 * 9091 = 1[9091]1; hence, 91 and 9091 are terms of M_21.",
        "Since 10^(q+1)+1 mod (k-10) is periodic and the period length cannot exceed k-10, it is easy to check that the sequence is indeed full. - _Giovanni Resta_, Nov 26 2019"
