        "Using the formulae in C. B. Bower's web link below about transforms, it can be proved that, for k >= 2, the BHK[k] transform of sequence (c(n): n >= 1), which has g.f. C(x) = Sum_{n >= 1} c(n)*x^n, has generating function B_k(x) = (1/2)*(C(x)^k - C(x^2)^{k/2}) if k is even, and B_k(x) = C(x)*B_{k-1}(x) = (C(x)/2)*(C(x)^{k-1} - C(x^2)^{(k-1)/2}) if k is odd. For k=1, Bower assumes that the BHK[k=1] transform of (c(n): n >= 1) is itself, which means that the g.f. of the output sequence is C(x). (This assumption is not accepted by all mathematicians because a sequence of length 1 not only is reversible but palindromic as well.)",
        "Since a(m) = BHK(c(n): n >= 1)(m) = Sum_{k=1..m} BHK[k](c(n): n >= 1)(m) for m = 1,2,3,..., it can be easily proved (using sums of infinite geometric series) that the g.f. of BHK(c(n): n >= 1) is A(x) = (C(x)^2 - C(x^2))/(2*(1-C(x))*(1-C(x^2))) + C(x). (The extra C(x) is due of course to the special assumption made for the BHK[k=1] transform.)",
        "Here, BHK(c(n): n >= 1)(m) indicates the m-th element of the output sequence when the transform is BHK and the input sequence is (c(n): n >= 1). Similarly, BHK[k](c(n): n >= 1)(m) indicates the m-th element of the output sequence when the transform is BHK[k] (i.e., with k boxes) and the input sequence is (c(n): n >= 1).",
        "For the current sequence, c(n) = 2 for all n >= 1, and thus, C(x) = 2*x/(1-x). Substituting into the above formula for A(x), and doing the algebra, we get A(x) = x*(2-5*x-4*x^2+15*x^3)/((1-x)*(1-3*x)*(1-3*x^2)), which is the formula conjectured by _Colin Barker_ below.",
        "Using partial fraction decomposition, we get A(x) = (1/3) + 2*x/(1-x) + (1/3)/(1-3*x) - (1/3 + 1/(2*sqrt(3)))/(1-sqrt(3)*x) + (-1/3 + 1/(2*sqrt(3)))/(1 + sqrt(3)*x). From this, we get a(n) = 2 + 3^{n-1} - 2*3^{(n/2) -1} when n is even and a(n) = 2 + 3^{n-1} -3^{(n-1)/2} when n is odd, which verify _Ralf Stephan_'s formula below.",
