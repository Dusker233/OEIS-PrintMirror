        "A cells mapping scheme (CMS) for an ordered pair (A,B) of Latin squares is a permutation p of N^2 integer numbers from 0 to N^2-1 such that p[i] = j, 0 <= i, j <= N^2-1 iff A[i] = B[j] (square\u2019s elements are listed left-to-right and top-to-bottom in the string representation). Used for getting ESODLS (see A309210). Structure of the multiset of cycle lengths in the CMS provides cycle of ESODLS with length equal to the least common multiple of cycle lengths in the CMS.",
