        "The graph of this sequence has inflections when n first exceeds exp(prime(k)) for some k. See A051102. It appears that (2400, 2401) and (4374, 4375) are the only consecutive numbers in this sequence. See A116486 for a slightly different definition of logarithmically smooth.",
        "The sequence is closed under multiplication, since if x,y are sequence terms, and a prime p divides x, then p is less than log(x), which is less than log(xy). - _Richard Locke Peterson_, Apr 12 2020",
        "The Euler phi function of a(n) need not be logarithmically smooth, since phi(27)=18. This differs from k-smooth numbers. - _Richard Locke Peterson_, May 09 2020"
