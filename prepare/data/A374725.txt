        "A more formal definition can be given as follows: a(1) = 1; for n > 1, let x be the least significant digit of a(n-1); then a(n) = a(n-1) * (10*x + y), with y being the most significant digit of a(n). Choose the smallest such y if such a y exists. If no such y exists, the sequence ends. We also restrict y to being a nonzero digit.",

        "Choosing other values for a(1) yields finite sequences up to a(1) = 10000 as long as a(1) is not of the form 1...0 otherwise the sequence is constant and infinite. For example, if a(1) = 120, then a(2) = 120 because 120 * 01 = 120."
