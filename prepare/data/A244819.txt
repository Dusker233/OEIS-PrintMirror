Shown by the lifting theorem (e.g., Apostol) for prime powers. Note that for prime 2 there is one solution of j^2 + 3 == 0 (mod 2) this corresponds the imprimitive reduced form (2, 2, 2), not to the one reduced primitive form (1, 0, 3) for discriminant -12 (A000003(3) = 1). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Mar 02 2021"
