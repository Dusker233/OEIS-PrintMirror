        "Given that highly composite numbers (HCNs) are products of primorials, we note the following:",
        "1. The only odd term is 1.",
        "2. The only primorials, i.e., terms in A002110, are {1, 2, 6}, consequently the only squares in A002182 are {1, 4, 36}.",
        "3. The only terms in A000079 are {1, 2, 4, 8}. These produce {1, 2, 6}, {4, 12, 30}, {24, 120, 840}, and {48, 240, 1680}, in A002182 respectively.",
        "3. This sequence is a subset of A025487, which is a subset of A055932.",
        "Also given that A002182 strictly increases, we note that i <= m <= j, integers, for which P = k * A002110(m) produces HCNs. As we increment m we increase the rank of the tensor of prime divisor power ranges and double the number of divisors. However, we may have another term P' = a * A002110(b) for a > k and b < (j + 1) such that P' < P yet tau(P') >= tau(P). This P' is in A002182 and has increased tau by the lengthening of the power ranges for relatively small primes via some composite b instead of increasing the rank of the tensor. Since A002182 strictly increases, we have a limited range for m.",
        "There are 19 terms also in A002182: 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 120, 240, 360, 720, 5040, 7560, 10080, 15120, 20160, 50400, 17297280.",
