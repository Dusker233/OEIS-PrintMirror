        "Numbers m, not divisible by 10, such that for some k, m*10^k is in A322323. - _David A. Corneth_, Dec 09 2018, corrected by _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 19 2018",
        "In A322323 it is shown that the set of these self-stuffable numbers is the union of infinite subsequences produced from the roots M listed here, as follows: If E(M) = A007953(M) - A055642(M) = sumdigits(M) - #digits(M) > 0, then N = M*10^E(M) has a number of digits equal to its sum of digits, L = A007953(N) = A055642(N). Then S(N) is well defined, where S(N) is the number obtained from N by inserting d[i] spaces after each nonzero digit d[i] of N except for the last digit, and then filling these spaces by a second copy of the digits of N. (More generally, this S(x) is well defined iff E(x) = A010879(x).) If additionally N | S(N), then N is in A322323, a self-stuffable number. Moreover, all numbers N_m = Sum_{k=0..2m} 10^(k*L)*N, m >= 0, have the same property. If 10*M leads to such an N, then M leads to the same N. Therefore we call roots and list here only those M leading to self-stuffable N which are not divisible by 10.",
        "a(13) = 22 and a(31) = 126 are the only known cases of primitive roots M with the additional property that E(M) = A010879(M), the last digit of M, in which case all M_m = Sum_{k=0..2m} 10^(k*L)*M, m >= 0, are also self-stuffable (if M | S(M)). A322323 is the union of the sets {N_m, m >= 0}, and {M_m, m >= 0} if E(M) = A010879(M), where M runs over all terms listed here. [Edited by _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 19 2018]",
