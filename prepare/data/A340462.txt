    "comment": [
        "A PPT is generated from the Euclid formula using parameters m, n where the hypotenuse is m^2+n^2, the odd leg is m^2-n^2 and the even leg is 2*m*n with m>n, m+n odd and GCD(m,n) = 1. For a triangular number to be the hypotenuse of a PPT it must be the sum of two squares and have all its prime factors congruent to 1 (mod 4). If a(n) is the k-th triangular number, then k is a member of A337156 such that the PPT has a second triangular number as either the odd or even leg.",

The first and second pair can be used to generate two PPT's (325,323,36) and (325,253,204) and these PPT's contain a second triangular number 36 and 253 respectively."
