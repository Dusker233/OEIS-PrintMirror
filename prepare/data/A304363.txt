    "comment": [
        "These trajectories may be called \"station-keeping\" in that, like a satellite correcting perturbations to its orbit as they arise, these trajectories continue (for a time) to be directed toward their starting values. (Using even numbers as starting values results in a smaller relative initial step away from the starting value, i.e., from a(n) downward to a(n)/2 rather than from a(n) upward to 3*a(n)+1.)",
        "If the Collatz conjecture is true, there are no cycles, i.e., there exists no number k > 1 whose trajectory ever returns to k, so for each starting value k, the pattern of being directed back toward k at every step after the initial downward step is eventually broken; this occurs when the trajectory reaches either an odd number greater than k (and thus moves even farther upward above k) or an even number less than k (and thus moves even farther downward below k). (For the case n=0, the trajectory from k=2, on its initial step downward, goes immediately to 1 and stops.)",
        "It can be shown that the difference between distinct consecutive terms is always a power of 2."
