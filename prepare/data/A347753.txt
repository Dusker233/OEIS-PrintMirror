    "comment": [
        "For a row of n adjacent cubes create all possible planes defined by connecting any three of their vertices. For example, in the case of a single cube this results in fourteen planes; six planes between the pairs of parallel edges connected to each end of the face diagonals, and eight planes from connecting the three vertices adjacent to each corner vertex. Use all the resulting planes to cut the entire solid into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the numbers of resulting polyhedra for n adjacent cubes.",
