        "All terms > a(1) are primes p such that either (2*p+1)/5 or (4*p+1)/5 is prime. A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for prime p > 3 to be a term is that its final digit must be 7 or 1 (otherwise (2*p+1), (4*p+1) respectively cannot be divisible by 5). The Maple code below computes terms > a(1)."
