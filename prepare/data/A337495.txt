        "The consecutive-123-avoiding stack-sorting map acts on permutations of length 3 by reversing every permutation except 321, which gets sent to 213. The permutation 213 has 2 preimages under this map (namely, 312 and 321), and every other permutation of length 3 has at most one preimage. Hence, a(3)=2."
