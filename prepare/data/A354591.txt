        "This is true.  In other words, k is in the sequence if and only if k is even and divisible by 3, 4 or 5.  Proof: the positive integer solutions of 1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d = 1 can be enumerated explicitly, and each contains at least one even number and at least one divisible by 3, 4 or 5.  Of course k = k/a + k/b + k/c + k/d if and only if 1 = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d, and this writes k as the sum of 4 divisors of k if k is divisible by a,b,c, and d.  If k is even and divisible by 3, we can use 1 = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6; if divisible by 4, 1 = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4; if even and divisible by 5, 1 = 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/5 + 1/10. - _Robert Israel_, Sep 01 2022",
