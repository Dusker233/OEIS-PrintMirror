        "These partitions are characterized by either being a twin (x,x) or having a wiggly permutation. A sequence is wiggly if it is alternately strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, starting with either. For example, the partition (3,2,2,2,1) has no wiggly permutations, even though it has anti-run permutations (2,3,2,1,2) and (2,1,2,3,2)."
