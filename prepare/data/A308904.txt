        "The 2-smooth numbers are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (A000079, the powers of 2), so exactly half of the 8 numbers in the interval [1..8] are 2-smooth numbers: the 8/2 = 4 numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8. For all numbers k > 8, the number of 2-smooth numbers in [1..k] is less than k/2, so 8 is the largest k at which the number of 2-smooth numbers in [1..k] is exactly k/2, so a(1)=8. (The smallest k at which the number of 2-smooth numbers in [1..k] is exactly k/2 is A290154(1) = 6.)",
        "The 3-smooth numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 32, ... (A003586). It can be shown that k=20 is the only number k such that exactly half of the numbers in the interval [1..k] are 3-smooth. Since k=20 is the only such number, 20 is both a(2) and A290154(2)."
