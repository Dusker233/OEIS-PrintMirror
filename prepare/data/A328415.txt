        "Numbers k being powers of 2 or 3 such that 2*k+1 is not prime.",
        "Proof. If m is a solution to (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_(2k) such that m is odd, then 2*m is also a solution, and vice versa. So if there is only one solution to (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_(2k), m must be a multiple of 4. If 8 divides m and m has odd prime factors, or if m has at least two distinct odd prime factors, then A046072(m) >= 3, a contradiction. So m = 2^e, e >= 3 or m = 4*p^e, p odd prime and e >= 1. If m = 4*p^e and p >= 5, then (Z/(3*p^e)Z)* = (Z/mZ)*. So we have m = 2^e, e >= 3 or m = 4*3^e, e >= 1, then (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_(2*2^(e-3)) or (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_(2*3^(e-1)).",
        "If k = 2^(e-3) > 1 and p = 2*k+1 is prime, then (Z/(3*p)Z)* = (Z/(2^e)Z)*; if k = 3^(e-1) > 1 and p = 2*k+1 is prime, then (Z/(3*p)Z)* = (Z/(4*3^e)Z)*; on the other hand, if k is a power of 2 or a power of 3 such that 2*k+1 is not prime, then (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_(2k) indeed has only one solution."
