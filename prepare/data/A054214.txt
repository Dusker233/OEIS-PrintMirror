        "If n=(10^m-1)^2+1 where m is a positive integer then n is in the sequence. Because then n has 2m digits and n concatenated with n-1 is n*10^(2m)+(n-1) = (10^(2m)-10^m+1)^2. for example, taking m=1 we get 82, the first term of the sequence. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 22 2013",
        "As pointed out by _Georg Fischer_, it is very plausible that all of A054214, A116123, and A116142 contain exactly the same terms. If that is indeed true, then A054214 should be edited to mention the alternative constructions, and the other two sequences declared \"dead\". However, this needs careful analysis to deal with the possibilities that n, n-2, and n-5 may not all have the same number of digits. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 30 2018. Nov 05 2018: Thanks to Giovanni Resta_ (see below), this has now been done. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 05 2018",

        "For n and n-5 to have a different digit length, we must have n = 10^k+h with 0<=h<=4.",
        "We want to prove that in this case the concatenation of n and n-5 cannot be of the form m(m+4). The numbers m(m+4) modulo 9 can only be equal to 0, 3, 5, or 6, but it is easy to see that the concatenation of 10^k+h and 10^k+h-5 can be equal to one of these values modulo 9 only if h=0.",
        "Now, the concatenation of 10^k and 10^k-5 is equal to 3 modulo 4 for every k>1, but m(m+4) modulo 4 can only be equal to 0 or 1, so A116123 is indeed equal to this sequence.",
        "Using an identical argument (with mods 9 and 4) we can prove that the concatenation of n and n-2, when n and n-2 have a different number of digits, cannot be equal to m(m+2) and so A116142 is equal to this sequence. (End)"
