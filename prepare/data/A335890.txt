    "comment": [
        "Two words x, y are 4-binomial equivalent if the word binomial coefficients (x|r) and (y|r) coincide for all words r of length 4. A word binomial coefficient (x|r) gives the number of times the word r appears as a (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence of x. Observe that if (x|r) and (y|r) coincide for all words r of length 4, then (x|r') and (y|r') coincide for all words r' of length at most 4.",
        "The integer-valued vector (x|r)_r where the index r runs through all possible binary words of length 4 is referred to as the 4-deck of x. Hence, the number of distinct 4-decks is equal to the number of equivalence classes."
