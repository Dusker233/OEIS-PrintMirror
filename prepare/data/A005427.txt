(Burde uses the numbers 0 through m-1 probably because he relates this problem to the representation of m in the fractional base k/(k-1) = 4/3. He actually modifies the (4/3)-representation of m to include negative coefficients. See the coefficients f(n;k) below.)",

        "We use the following recursions but we start at T(k;k) (rather than at the smallest n for which T(n;k) >= k). Define the sequence (S(n;k): n >= 1) by S(n;k) = T(n+k-1; k) for n >= 1. (It is easy to prove that S(1;k) = T(k;k) = 1.)",
