        "For the counting of algebraic numbers one also has to use the signed versions with leading sign +, and consider only irreducible polynomials. Therefore, if only real algebraic numbers are considered, [1, 0, 1] does not qualify, because it leads to a pair of complex conjugate roots, and the signed version [1, 0, -1] gives a reducible polynomial."
