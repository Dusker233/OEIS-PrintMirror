        "From _David A. Corneth_, Aug 24 2019: (Start)",
        "Only 5 pairs are known up to 4*10^18. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n^2 and (n + 1)^2 for every positive integer n. The conjecture has been verified up to n = 2*10^9. So to that bound we only have to check for two prime powers where at least one has an exponent of at least 3. That has been done to prime powers <= 10^22.",
        "If there is another pair besides the first five listed with both numbers <= 10^22 then Legendre's conjecture is false.",
        "Proof: If there is another such pair with both numbers <= 10^22 then it must be of the form [p^2, q^2] where p is a prime and q is the least prime larger than p. Then q - p >= 2 (as p != 2). So there is no prime between p^2 and q^2 and hence there is no prime between p^2 and (p+1)^2. This is a counterexample to Legendre's conjecture. (End)"
