        "We define the multiset multiplicity kernel (MMK) of a positive integer n to be the product of (least prime factor with exponent k)^(number of prime factors with exponent k) over all distinct exponents k appearing in the prime factorization of n. For example, 90 has prime factorization 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^1, so for k = 1 we have 2^2, and for k = 2 we have 3^1, so MMK(90) = 12. As an operation on multisets MMK is represented by A367579, and as an operation on their ranks it is represented by A367580."
