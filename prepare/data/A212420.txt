        "These primes are the prime numbers p greater than 3 such that for every elliptic curves with conductor of the form 18p, 36p, or 72p we have that 4 does not divide the order of the torsion subgroup over the rationals but at least one curve with 2 dividing this order, such that there is a prime q congruent to 1 modulo 6 such that 4 does not divide the order of the torsion subgroup over the finite field of size q."
