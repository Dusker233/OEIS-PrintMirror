    "comment": [
        "\"There are 8 potential primes modulo 30....\" Using only the potential prime locations within this domain there are no consecutive integers within the domain until an integer is determined to have a prime factor, here the first such integer is 49. When an integer is determined to be composite then there is a \"gap\" within the succession of primes.",
        "While the location of the first few record consecutive integers differ from established maximal gaps, they quickly become the same. It is not known if they continue to remain the same or if some variation may occur. Here the record number of composites will always be lower because the count of composites are only those that are within this domain.",
