        "This sequence may contain gaps, as there are some prime bases for which no Wieferich primes are known. Those bases are 47, 139, 311, 347, 983, .... (see Fischer link).",
        "Any prime whose trajectory leads to a prime in this sequence is also a term of the sequence. Therefore, if the trajectory of any of the bases mentioned in the previous comment leads to a term in the sequence, then that base and any prime bases where it is the smallest Wieferich prime are also terms. - _Felix Fr\u00f6hlich_, Mar 25 2015"
