        "The above conjecture is correct because there are 2*(a(k+1)-a(k)) terms that are not divisible by 4 in the k-th interval which are determined by terms that are divisible by 4. For example, there are 2*(a(2)-a(1)) = 2*(6-2) = 8 terms between a(5) = 16 and a(14) = 48 because numbers of the form 2*s are always terms where s is an odd number. So first differences of a(n) determine the corresponding intervals and the formula above always holds. - _Altug Alkan_, Sep 24 2018",
