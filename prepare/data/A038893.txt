        "These primes correspond to the representation of the two classes of discriminant 21 of binary quadratic forms with principal reduced forms [1, 3, -3] and [3, 3, -1]. The first class represents the primes given in A141159 (or A139492). The second class gives the prime 3 (which divides 21), and primes congruent to 2 (mod 3) and also to 3, 5, 6 (mod 7). The solution of x^2 - 21 == 0 (mod p) leads to the representative primitive parallel forms for discriminant 21 and representation of primes p. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 19 2019",
