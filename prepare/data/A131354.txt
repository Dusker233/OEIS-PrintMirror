        "This is to tribonacci numbers A000073 as A052011 is to Fibonacci numbers and as A052012 is to Lucas numbers A000204. It is mere coincidence that all values until a(12) = 38 are themselves Fibonacci. The formula plus the known asymptotic prime distribution gives the asymptotic approximation of this sequence, which is the same even if we use one of the alternative definitions of tribonacci with different initial values."
