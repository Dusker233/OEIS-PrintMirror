        "Numbers of the form 10n + 9 (A017377) not in A030433. Obviously multiples of 2 or 5 can't be in A017377 nor this sequence. All other primes occur as factors of these terms infinitely often. For example: If n is a multiple of 3, then 10n + 9 is in this sequence; if n = 4 mod 7, then 10n + 9 is in this sequence; if n = 9 mod 11, then 10n + 9 is in this sequence; and so on and so forth. The first of these congruences to be satisfied determines the least prime factor of 10n + 9. - _Alonso del Arte_, Jun 23 2011"
