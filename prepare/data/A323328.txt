    "comment": [
        "318 is the least number k whose repeated iteration of the mapping k -> A001615(k) - k yields an unbounded sequence. Since t(m^j * n) = m^j * t(n) if m|n, then if in the sequence a_0 = k, a_1 = t(k), a_2 = t(t(k))... there is a term a_{i1} = m^j * a_0 such that m|k and j > 0 then a_{i+i1} = m^j * a_i for all i and thus the sequence is unbounded. Since a(13)=9870, after 19 iterations a(32) = 27 * 9870, 27 = 3^3 and 3|9870 then a(n+19) = 27 * a(n) for n >= 13."
