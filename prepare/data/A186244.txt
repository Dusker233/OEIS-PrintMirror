For n = 3, we add {0,1,2} to 00, and {100,200} to the empty string to get the 5 strings of length 3 which have 00 in them.

In the first case, there are 2*a(n-1) strings, since any string of length n-1 containing 00 can be made into an appropriate string of length n by appending either of the values {0,1,2} that are not the same as the (n-1)-th digit. The case where the last two digits are the same has two subcases: to any string of length n-2 containing 00, we can append 11 or 22. There are 2*a(n-2) strings in this subcase. Or, to any string of length n-2 (whether or not it contains 00), we can append 00. There are 3^(n-2) strings in this subcase. - _Todd CadwalladerOlsker_, Oct 24 2020",
