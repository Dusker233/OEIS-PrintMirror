        "The vast majority of terms are odd - in the first one million terms only 74 even numbers appear. Interestingly most of those even number appear in A014741, although that sequence contains many even numbers that do not appear here, e.g. 126, while this sequence contains even numbers not appearing in that sequence, e.g. 326."
