        "When n is a term, 16n is also. This can be proved as follows:",
        "(1) If w is odd, then 16n - w^4 == 7 (mod 8), and it follows from Legendre's three-square theorem that the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^4 + w^4 = 16n has no solution (it is the same when x, y or z are odd numbers).",
        "(2) If x, y, z and w are even numbers (x = 2a, y = 2b, z = 2c, w = 2d) such that x^2 + y^2 + z^4 + w^4 = 16n, then a^2 + b^2 = 4(n - c^4 - d^4). So there are integers u and v satisfying u^2 + v^2 = n - c^4 - d^4. i.e. u^2 + v^2 + c^4 + d^4 = n, which is a contradiction.",
