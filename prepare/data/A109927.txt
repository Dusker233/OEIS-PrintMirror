        "These primes may be part of Cunningham chains longer than three terms. It seems the two operators are never mixed, except for 3, 5 and 7: -for 3, we have: 2 through <2p-1> -> 3 through <2p+1> -> 7 -for 5: 3 <2p-1> -> 5 <2p+1> -> 11 -for 7: 3 <2p+1> -> 7 <2p-1> -> 13",
        "For p > 7, such a mixed chain with p in the middle is impossible because the number 3 would be a nontrivial factor of either the smallest or the largest term. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, May 05 2019",
