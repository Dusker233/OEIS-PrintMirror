        "The palindromic length of a sequence is the minimum number of terms needed to write it as a concatenation of palindromes. For example, 011010 has palindromic length 3, as it can be written as (0110)(1)(0) or (0)(11)(010), but there is no way to write it as the concatenation of two palindromes.",
