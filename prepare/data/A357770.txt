    "name": "Number of 2n-step closed paths on quasi-regular rhombic (rhombille) lattice starting from a degree-3 node.",
    "comment": [
        "Paths that return to the same point in a quasi-regular rhombic lattice must always have even length (i.e., 2n) because of parity: degree-3 nodes alternate with degree-6 nodes."
    ],
    "example": [
        "a(2)=30, because there are 3*3=9 paths that visit one of three adjacent vertices, return to the origin, and again visit an adjacent vertex and return to the origin; 3*5=15 paths visiting one of five distance-2 vertices that are adjacent to the three adjacent vertices; plus 3*2=6 paths traversing the perimeter of three adjacent rhombi in counterclockwise or clockwise direction; all resulting in a closed path of length 2n=2*2=4."

        "The accompanying sequences for the number of paths that return to a degree-6 node is A357771.",
