        "Also numbers k such that the minima of the maximal anti-runs in the weakly increasing sequence of prime factors of k (with multiplicity) are identical. Here, an anti-run is a sequence with no adjacent equal parts, and the minima of the maximal anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal anti-run subsequences and taking the least term of each. Note the prime factors can alternatively be taken in weakly decreasing order.",
