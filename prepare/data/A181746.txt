        "Terms in this sequence are the terms which are repeated in A121732.",
        "This sequence is infinitely long. For example, there exists two non-isomorphic irreducible E8 representations of dimension n^120 * 8634368000 for any n>0 (the dimension formula is homogeneous of degree 120 after a suitable change of variables). I have found no dimension with more than two non-isomorphic irreducible E8 representations. - _Andy Huchala_, Nov 22 2020"
