        "The second Mathematica program below generates the first 40 terms of the sequence given a value for nn of 15000. To generate the first 50 terms of the sequence the value of nn needs to be increased to about 32000. If a given value of nn is too low for the number of terms desired, this problem will be signaled by one or more of the generated terms being \"NotFound\" in which case increasing the value of nn appropriately should permit generating the desired number of terms. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jul 10 2018"
