        "Number n is in this sequence exactly when two parts of the symmetric representation of sigma(n) meet at the diagonal.",
        "Proof: If n = k*(2*k+1) is in this sequence then the length of row n in A240542 is 2*k and that of row n-1 is 2*k-1, i.e., the last leg of the Dyck path for n down to the diagonal is vertical and that for n-1 is horizontal to the same point on the diagonal. Therefore, one part of the symmetric representation of sigma(n) ends at the diagonal and so does its symmetric copy. Conversely, if two parts meet at the diagonal then the number of legs in the Dyck path to the diagonal for n, i.e., the length of row n in A240542, is one larger than that for n-1 and must be even, i.e., n has the form n = k*(2*k+1).",
        "A156592 is a subsequence since for every number of the form n = p*(2*p+1) where both p and 2*p+1 are primes A240542(n) = A240542(n-1). For a proof let T(n,k) = ceiling((n+1)/k - (k+1)/2) for 1 <= k <= floor((sqrt(8*n+1) - 1)/2) = 2*p, see A235791; then T(n,k) = T(n-1,k) + 1 for k = 1, 2, p, 2*p, and T(n,k) = T(n-1,k) for all other k. Therefore, the two alternating sums defining A240542(n) and A240542(n-1) are equal, i.e., their Dyck paths meet at the diagonal.",
