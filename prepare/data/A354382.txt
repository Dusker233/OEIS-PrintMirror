    "comment": [
        "See A057787 for a description of polyarcs. The pseudo-polyarcs are constructed in the same way as ordinary polyarcs, but allowing for corner-connections. Thus they generalize polyarcs in the same way that pseudo-polyominoes (aka polyplets, A030222) generalize ordinary polyominoes (A000105). They can also be viewed as the \"rounded\" variant of pseudo-polytans (A354380), in the same way that ordinary polyarcs are the rounded variant of ordinary polytans (A006074).",
        "Two figures are considered equivalent if they differ only by a rotation or reflection.",
        "The pseudo-polyarcs grow tremendously fast, much faster than most polyforms. The initial data that have been computed suggest an asymptotic growth rate of at least 36^n."
