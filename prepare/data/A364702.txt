        "Sequence T = A286708 represents numbers in A001694 that are not prime powers. Numbers k in T are such that k = m*r^2, m >= 1, by definition. Since we may rewrite q*r < k instead as q*r < m*r^2, it is clear since omega(r) > 1, that q < r. Further, we may rewrite p*r <= k instead as p*r <= m*r^2, and since p | r, p < r as omega(r) > 1, we see that S contains T.",
