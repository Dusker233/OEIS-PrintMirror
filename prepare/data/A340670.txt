        "Complex base i-1 of Khmelnik and Penney uses an integer m to represent a complex integer point z(m) = A318438(m) + A318439(m)*i.  A340669(m) is the negation of z in this representation.  a(n) is how many n-bit m are negatable within those n bits, i.e., how many m in the range 0 <= m < 2^n have also 0 <= A340669(m) < 2^n.",
        "A geometric interpretation of a(n) is to draw a unit square around each point z(0) to z(2^n-1), rotate a copy by 180 degrees about the origin, and measure its area of intersection with the original.",
        "The bit-flip rule in A340669 gives the recurrence formula below.  A low 0-bit of m has a(n-1) negatables above it, or low 11 is one arbitrary bit then negatables above so 2*a(n-3), or low 01 is three arbitrary so 8*a(n-5).  This can be thought of the number of compositions of n (partitions with order) into parts 1,3,5 with 2 types of part 3 and 8 types of part 5."
