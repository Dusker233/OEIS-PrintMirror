        "Williams 1982 (p. 86), notes that p = 13, 31 and 1546463 are the only primes less than 10^8 for which the Pell quotient vanishes mod p. Elsenhans and Jahnel, \"The Fibonacci sequence modulo p^2,\" p. 5, report in effect that there are no more such primes p < 10^9.",
        "Williams 1991 (p. 440), and Sun 1995 pt. 3, Theorem 3.3, together prove a set of formulas connecting the Pell quotient with the Fermat quotient (base 2) (A007663) and harmonic numbers like H(floor(p/8)) (see example in the Formula section below). As is well known, the vanishing of the Fermat quotient (base 2) is a necessary condition for the failure of the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem (see discussion under A001220); and in light of a corresponding result of Dilcher and Skula concerning this type of harmonic number, the vanishing of the Pell quotient mod p is also a necessary condition for the failure of the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem.",

Dutta, Patel, Ray, 2019). This is an improvement of an earlier result stating there are at least log(x)/log(log(x)) balancing non-Wieferich primes p == 1 (mod k) less than x (cf. Theorem 3.2 in Rout 2016). (End)"
