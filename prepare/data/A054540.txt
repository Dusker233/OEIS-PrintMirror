    "comment": [
        "The sequence was found by a computer search of all of the equal divisions of the octave from 1 to over 3985011. There seems to be a hidden aspect or mystery here: what is it about the more and more harmonious equal temperaments that causes them to express themselves collectively as a perfect, self-accumulating recurrent sequence?",
        "From _Eliora Ben-Gurion_, Dec 15 2022: (Start)",
        "The answer is because temperament mappings can be added. If harmonic correspondences are written in a bra, that is <N2 N3 N5], where Nx is the step corresponding to the x-th harmonic, then these types of one-row matrices can be added and the resulting temperament will represent them as well. In case of temperaments with high precision, this also leads to another high-precision temperament. Such a bra notation is referred to as \"val\" by the microtonal music community, and in simple words, vals can be added together to produce another val.",
        "Example: a tuning with 118 equal steps to the octave has a second harmonic on the 118th step by definition, the third harmonic is approximated with 187 steps, and the fifth is with 274 steps, which leads to <118 187 274]. A 171 equal division system will have a corresponding bra <171 271 397]. When these two are added, we obtain <289 458 671], which is exactly how the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th harmonics are represented in 289 equal divisions of the octave. (End)"
