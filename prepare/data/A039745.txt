        "The distinction between A039745 (this sequence) and A186783 comes from whether we treat the Cayley graph of the generating set as directed or undirected (alternatively, whether we allow multiplication by inverses of generators when constructing elements). A039745 deals with the directed Cayley graph, while A186783 deals with the undirected one. - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 09 2011"
