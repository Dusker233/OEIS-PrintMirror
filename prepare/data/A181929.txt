        "The main idea behind my program is that if we say start searching from 10000, which is 10011... binary, then as the binary string for the first 5 places is larger than our decimal value, then the decimal value can be immediately jumped to 10011 for the next search number. Repeating this process (while also doing slight jumps if the decimal value is larger than the binary), allows ones to do very large jumps in the checked decimal values, sometimes eliminating an entire string of length n in just a few checks. I got the idea from similar people were using when searching for the next term in A258107. - _Scott R. Shannon_, Feb 25 2021"
