        "The symmetric representation of sigma (cf. A237593), SRS(a(n)), of any number in this sequence has between 4 and 8 regions with 3 regions impossible because p1 < p2 < p3 implies 2*p3 < p1*p2. When there are 8 regions they all have width 1 and their areas are the prime numbers (d+a(n)/d)/2 for the 4 respective pairs of divisors of a(n). In general, the areas of the regions in SRS(a(n)) need not be prime, except for the two symmetric outer regions (n+1)/2. - _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Jan 09 2021"
