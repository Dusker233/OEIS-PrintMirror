        "The null subgraph is not considered to be connected.",
        "In A369606, two isomorphic subgraphs may both be counted, namely if there is no automorphism of the hypercube graph that takes one to the other. The first difference is a(4) = 194 < A369606(4) = 209. For example, the path with 5 vertices is an induced subgraph of the 4-dimensional hypercube in two inequivalent ways: one that is contained in a 3-dimensional subcube and one that is not."
