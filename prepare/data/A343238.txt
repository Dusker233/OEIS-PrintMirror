        "This sequence includes A139513, that is, Legendre(-5, p) = +1 for odd primes not 5, that is, primes congruent to {1, 3, 7, 9} mod 20. Here 5 is a member of the sequence with solution x = 0.",
        "The primes of this sequence are given in A240920.",
        "The present sequence gives the numbers of the form 2^a*5^b*Product_{j=1..m} (p_j)^e(j), with a and b from {0, 1}, p_j a prime from {1, 3, 7, 9} (mod 20), i.e., from A139513, m >= 0 and e(j) >= 0 (this includes the number 1). These numbers are ordered increasingly.",
        "This follows from the Legendre-symbol(-5, p)= +1  and the lifting theorem (see, e.g., Apostol, Theorem 5.30, p. 121-2) for p = 2 and 5 (no lifting for the solutions for p = 2 and p = 5), and the unique lifting for the primes satisfying Legendre-symbol(-5, p) = +1.",
        "Therefore the number of representative solutions x from {0, 1, ..., a(n)-1}, denoted by M(a(n)), is 1 for precisely four cases: a(1) = 1 (x = 0), a(2) = 2  (x = 1), a(4) = 5 (x = 0) and a(8) = 10 = 2*5 (x = 5). For each of the mentioned prime powers there are just 2 solutions. This implies that for the number of solutions in the general a(n) case, n not 1, 2, 4, 8, only the primes p_j are of interest: M(a(n)) = 2^m(n).",
        "For these solutions x see A343239, and for the multiplicity M(a(n)) see A343240.",
        "This congruence is needed to find all proper solutions of the positive definite binary quadratic form of discriminant Disc = -20 = -4*5 representing k = a(n). The solutions x lead to the so-called representative parallel primitive forms (rpapfs). See A344231 for more details.",
