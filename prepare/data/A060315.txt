        "I had written a C++ program to find the smallest positive integer that cannot be obtained from the integers {1,2,...,n-1} using each number exactly once and the operators +,-,*,/. The result is the same as this sequence through n=11. It takes the program two days to find the result for n=11. We still don't know whether the two sequences are the same for n greater than 11. - _Zhao Hui Du_, Oct 01 2008",
        "The first 12 terms are the same as the result of using all numbers from 0 to n-1 exactly once and only the operators +,-,* (so we could get all integers less than a(n) without the operator /). The minimal number which could not be reached using all numbers from 0 to 12 exactly once and only operators +,-,* is 10539427. But I have still not verified whether it is a(13). - _Zhao Hui Du_, Oct 08 2008",
