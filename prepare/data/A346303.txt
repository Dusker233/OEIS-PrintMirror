        "The position of the words 0, 00, 000, 0000... (all-zero) in A076478 is given by A000225. So this sequence is given by the subsequence A000225 and filling the gaps half-way up (until the leading 0 toggles) with odd numbers, from 7 to 9, from 15 to 21, from 31 to 45 etc. So the first differences are 2, 4, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 10, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 18, 2, 2,... which is A052548 with 1, 3, 7, 15,...
