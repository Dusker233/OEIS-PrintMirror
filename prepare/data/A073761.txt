        "Usually once a number has the desired property, so do all its multiples. However there are exceptions. 61*7 in base 10 is not equidistributed. Multiples of earlier numbers are not included here.",

        "There are 58 composite terms below 100000, 2 among which being even: a(239) = 25064 = 2^3 * 13 * 241, and a(613) = 72728 = 2^3 * 9091.",
        "Conjecture 1: let p be a prime such that ord(10,p) is a multiple of 10, where ord(a,m) denotes the multiplicative order of a modulo m. Then p is a term if and only if 10 is a primitive root modulo p.",
