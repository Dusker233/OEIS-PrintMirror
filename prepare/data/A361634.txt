        "Appears to be a supersequence of A210490, and so also of positive squares and squarefree numbers (A005117). The first term that belongs in here but not in A210490 is 48. The nonsquarefree terms that are not squares are of the form p^(4k)*a, where a is a squarefree number, p is prime, and k > 0. About half of perfect numbers are of this form; one example is 496 = 2^4*31. The sequence has an asymptotic density of about 0.6420."
