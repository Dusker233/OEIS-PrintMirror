        "All lunar primes must contain a 9, so this is a subsequence of A011539.",
        "Also, numbers k such that the lunar sum of the lunar prime divisors of k is k. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 23 2010",
        "We have changed the name from \"dismal arithmetic\" to \"lunar arithmetic\" - the old name was too depressing. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 06 2014",
        "(Lunar) composite numbers are not necessarily a product of primes. (For example 1 = 1*x for any x in {1, ..., 9} is not a prime but can't be written as the product of primes.) Therefore, to establish primality, it is not sufficient to consider only products of primes; one has to consider possible products of composite numbers as well. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 16 2018"
