        "This sequence, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ..., gives the stable range of the polynomial rings Z, Z[x_1], Z[x_1, x_2], Z[x_1, x_2, x_3], ...",
        "A note on terminology: \"stable range\" and \"stable rank\" are the same thing. In the English-speaking world, people have always used the term \"stable range\", which was what Bass had invented in the early '60s. When Russian workers wrote on this theme, of course they used a Russian translation of the term \"stable range\". When the term was translated back into English, it became \"stable rank\"! - T. Y. Lam, Nov 07 2021"
