    "comment": [
        "These are polyominoes of the regular tiling with Schl\u00e4fli symbol {4,4}. For oriented polyominoes, chiral pairs are counted as two. This is one of the five sequences, along with A001168, needed to calculate the number of oriented polyominoes, A000988. It is the C90(n/4) sequence in the Shirakawa link. The calculation follows Redelmeier's method of inner rings."
