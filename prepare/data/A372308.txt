        "As all the numbers 10,20,...,90,100 are terms, all numbers that are recursively 10 times these values are also terms as they just add an additional 2 and 5 to their parent's prime factor list.",
        "A number 999...9998 will be a term if it has two prime factors 2 and 4999...999. Therefore 999999999999998 and 999...9998 (with 54 9's) are both terms. See A056712."
