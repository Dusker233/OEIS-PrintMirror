        "Since A095371(19) = 40, to show that a(20) > 323 we use the fact that (10^323-1)/9) is a product of 4 primes and a 271-digit composite number C. We then use a computer search to show that C has no prime factor <= floor(C^(1/(41-4))) = 19858291. This implies that (10^323-1)/9) has less than 41 distinct prime factors. Applying this same approach to 337 and 353 (the only numbers between 323 and 359 for which the complete factorization of the corresponding repunit is not known) and using the factorization of (10^360-1)/9 with 44 distinct prime factors show that a(20) = 360 and A095371(20) = 44. This approach also shows that a(21) = 420 and A095371(21) = 55.",
