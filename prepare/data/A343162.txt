        "Sequence A343168 is a triangular array that gives the number of graphs on n vertices that are isometrically embeddable in the Hamming graph H(n,k). The present sequence gives the row sums of this triangle, and is a direct analog of A343463. The present sequence and A343463 agree up to n=5, and the graph above is the first difference between them. (End)"
