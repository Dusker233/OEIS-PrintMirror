        "Numbers that in ternary are the concatenation of i 1's with j 2's, i, j>=0. Also a(n) = A073216(n+1) - 1. Proof: Write a(n) as 1{m}2{n}, then adding 1 gives 1{m-1}20{n} for m>0 and 10{n} for m=0. Doubling yields 10{m-1}10{n} or 20{n}, respectively. These two forms exactly describe the forms of sums of two powers of 3, the two powers being 3^n and 3^(m+n). - _Hugo van der Sanden_"
