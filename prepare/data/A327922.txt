        "This sequence is the complement of A197504 with respect to the positive odd numbers. It collects all positive odd numbers m with 4 dividing phi(m).",
        "In the prime number factorization of an odd m >= 3 the largest even factor of phi(a(n)) is 2^{2*r1 + r3}, where r1 and r3 are the nonnegative number of distinct primes 1 (mod 4) and 3 (mod 4), respectively. This means that for m = a(n) one needs 2*r1 + r3 >= 2. See some examples below.",
        "The number of solutions of the congruence x^2 == +1 (mod a(n)) or (inclusive) x^2 == -1 (mod a(n)) is 2^(r1 + r3) + delta_{r3,0}*2^r1, with 2*r1 + r3 >= 2, where r1 and r3 are the number of distinct primes 1 (mod 4) and 3 (mod 4), respectively, in the prime number factorization of a(n), and delta is the Kronecker symbol.",
        "This follows from the result that primes 1 (mod 4) (A002144) have Legendre symbol (-1, p) = +1 and primes 3 (mod 4) (A002145) have (-1, p) = -1. The part (a) of the lifting theorem for powers of primes (Apostol, 5.30, pp. 121-122) is used. Also the theorem that for odd primes p there are exactly (p-1)/2 quadratic residues modulo p (and exactly (p-1)/2 nonresidues modulo p) is needed (see e.g., Silverman, ch. 20, Theorem 1, p. 151)."
