        "There may be values that are not given in the recurrence shown. This sequence is suggested by Ulas, p. 11, who supplied the recurrence. Abstract: In this paper we give solutions of certain Diophantine equations related to triangular and tetrahedral numbers and propose several problems connected with these numbers. The material of this paper was presented in part at the 11th International Workshop for Young Mathematicians - Number Theory, Krakow, 14-20 September 2008.",

        "a(n) = T(i)*T(j) where T(k) = A000292(k) = C(k+2,3) = k*(k+1)*(k+2)/6. If we define sequences u(n), v(n) recursively in the following way: u(0) = 1, v(0) = 1, u(n) = 17*u(n-1) + 36*v(n-1) + 20 = A361491(n), v(n) = 8*u(n-1) + 17*v(n-1) + 10 = A046176(n), then for each natural number n the following identity holds (v(n)*u(n)*(u(n + 1)))^2 = T(u(n))*T(2*u(n)). But this does not exclude the possibility that there are other elements of a(n) that do not come from this recurrence."
