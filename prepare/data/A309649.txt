        "This is a sieve constructed on the baise of A007097 (the \"primeth recurrence\"). Delete the elements of A007097 in the list of the prime numbers and take the smallest remaining prime and call it a(2). Start a new primeth recurrence series with a(2) as starting element instead of 1. Take b(1) to be a(2), then b(2) is the b(1)-th prime, then b(3) is the b(2)-th prime and so on. Delete also the numbers b(i) of this new sequence from the primes. Again take the smallest remaining prime and callit a(3). Start a new primeth recurrence series with this number a(3) as starting element. Continue this process and retain all smallest elements 1, a(2), a(3), a(4), ... The resulting sequence is 1, 7, 13, 19, 23, 29, 37, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 73, 79, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 113, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 163, 167, 173, 181, 193, 197, 199, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 251, 257, 263, ...",
