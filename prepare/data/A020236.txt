        "9 is a strong pseudoprime to base 10. It's not enough to check that 10^8 = 1 mod 9. Since 8 = 1 * 2^3, we also need to verify that 10 = 1 mod 9 and 10^2 = 1 mod 9 as well. Since these are both equal to 1, we see that 9 is indeed a strong pseudoprime to base 10.",
        "91 is also a strong pseudoprime to base 10. Besides checking that 10^90 = 1 mod 91, since 90 = 45 * 2, we also check that 10^45 = -1 mod 91; the -1 is enough to satisfy the definition of a strong pseudoprime.",
        "99 is a Fermat pseudoprime to base 10 (see A005939) but it is not a strong pseudoprime to base 10. Although 10^98 = 1 mod 99, since 98 = 49 * 2, we have to check 10^49 mod 99, and there we find not -1 nor 1 but 10. Therefore 99 is not in this sequence. (End)"
