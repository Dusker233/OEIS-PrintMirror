    "comment": [
        "The hexagonal graph has vertices which are the centers of identical regular hexagons tiling the plane and the centers of adjacent hexagons are connected. Alternatively, we can use an isomorphic representation in which the vertices are the elements of Z^2 and (x,y) is connected to (x-1,y),(x+1,y),(x,y-1),(x,y+1),(x-1,y-1),(x+1,y+1). A cluster of size t is a set of t points such that each pair of points of the set is on a connected path contained entirely within the set. A burst pattern is a labeling of Z^2 with 0's and 1's. The term a(n) denotes the number of different (up to a translation) burst patterns whose 1's are covered by a cluster of size n."
