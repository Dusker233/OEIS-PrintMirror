        "For definition of quantale see A354493.",
        "A quantale is strictly left-sided if every element x satisfies T * x = x, and strictly right-sided if every element x satisfies x * T = x. Here T denotes the top element of the underlying lattice.",
        "Transposition of the semigroup table yields a bijection between strictly left-sided and strictly right-sided quantales, so this sequence counts either type."
