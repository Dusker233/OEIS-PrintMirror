        "Related to Zarankiewicz's problem k_4(n) (cf. A006616 and other crossrefs) which asks the converse: how many 1's must be in an n X n {0,1}-matrix in order to guarantee the existence of an all-ones 4 X 4 submatrix. This complementarity leads to the given formula which was used to compute the given values."

        "For n = 5, having at most 2 nonzero entries in the n X n matrix guarantees that there is a 4 X 4 zero submatrix (delete, e.g., the row with the first nonzero entry, then the column with the second nonzero entry, if any), but if one allows 3 nonzero entries and they are placed on the diagonal, then there is no 4 X 4 zero submatrix. Hence, a(5) = 2."
