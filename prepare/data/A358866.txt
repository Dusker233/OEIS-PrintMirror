    "comment": [
        "It's easy to see that 2^i is not so expressible, for i >= 1.  One can prove that, for example, 7 is not so expressible by considering the intervals in which terms of A014486 lie.  Many numbers can be proved inexpressible by (for example) restricting numerator and denominator to be of even length, not of the form (10)*100(0|1)*, etc."
