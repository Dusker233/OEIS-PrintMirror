    "comment": [
        "Assuming that every even number above 6 is the sum of 2 distinct prime numbers, p + q (a slightly stronger version of the Goldbach conjecture), then every odd number m above 7 is of the form 1 + p + q, so A001065(p*q) = m. If this is true, then 5 is the only odd untouchable number (A005114).",
        "Alanen (1972) suggested the study of odd numbers that are being \"touched\" only by Goldbach solutions, i.e., odd numbers k such that there is no solution m to A001065(m) = k which is not a squarefree semiprime. He suggested that perhaps these numbers deserved to be called \"almost untouchable\" numbers."
