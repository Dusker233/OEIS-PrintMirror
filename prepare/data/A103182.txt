So any \"sliding number\" G produces an infinite chain of others: G*10, G*100, G*1000, etc. The first number in such a chain is called \"primitive\". [Note the sequence is not defined by way of decimal digits. The power-of-10 relationship merely makes it practical to illustrate examples using decimal fractions. - _Peter Munn_, Nov 29 2022]",

        "In the definition 1/r + 1/s is (r+s)/(r*s) and we can cancel out (r+s), so we are looking for all (r+s) with r and s positive integers, such that r*s is a (nonnegative integral) power of 10, sorted by (r+s). It follows, for example, that for a given k, the smallest (r+s) that is a solution is at least 2*sqrt(10^k) (equality when k is even, unless we also require r != s). - _Christopher Landauer_, Mar 10 2005",
