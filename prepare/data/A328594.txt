        "A finite sequence is aperiodic if all of its cyclic rotations are distinct. See A000740 or A027375 for details.",
        "Also numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order is aperiodic. The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 28 2020"
