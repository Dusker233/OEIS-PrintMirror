        "Prime Fibonacci numbers are divisible by themselves, thus the only purpose of the word \"composite\" in the definition is to exclude 1."

    "example": [
        "Fibonacci number 4181 equals 37*113, while the first few Fibonacci primes are 2, 3, 5, 13, 89, 233. Thus, 4181 is in the sequence. The next Fibonacci number 6765 is divisible by 5, which is a Fibonacci prime. Thus, 6765 is not in the sequence."
