    "name": "a(n) is the second component y of the distance vector (x,y) in an oblique 120-degree coordinate system, 0 <= y <= x, between two nodes of an infinite triangular lattice of one-ohm resistors, such that the resistance R between the two nodes is as close as possible to n ohms, i.e., abs(R - n) is minimized. x is A356203(n).",
