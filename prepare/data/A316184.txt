        "For the first entry of R=1, we have the polynomial x^3 - 3x + 1. Its roots, expressed as continued fractions, all have a common tail of 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 6, 11, ... The next examples are R=7 with the polynomial x^3 - 7x + 7, then R=9 with the polynomial x^3 - 9x + 9, and Q=35 with the polynomial x^3 - 21x + 35. Note that for the R=7 example, we get the common tail of 2, 3, 1, 6, 10, 5, ... which is contained in A039921."
