        "Randy Ekl discovered that a number that can be written in two ways as a sum of two fifth powers exceeds 4.01*10^30 and one that can be written in two ways as a sum of two sixth powers exceeds 7.25*10^26. - _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 07 2017",
        "According to the Mathworld links below, a(5) and a(6), if they exist, exceed 1.02*10^26 and 7.25*10^26, respectively. The page at the SquaresOfCubes link below says Stuart Gascoigne did an exhaustive search and found in Sep 2002 that no a(5) solution less than 3.26*10^32 exists. My exhaustive search has determined that any solutions for n > 5, if they exist, must exceed 2^96 (about 7.92*10^28). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Dec 15 2008",
