    "comment": [
        "Such a permutation is characterized by being neither a twin (x,x) nor wiggly (A025047, A345192). A sequence is wiggly if it is alternately strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, starting with either. For example, the partition (3,3,2,2,2,2,1) has no wiggly permutations, even though it has the anti-run permutations (2,3,2,3,2,1,2), (2,3,2,1,2,3,2), and (2,1,2,3,2,3,2)."
