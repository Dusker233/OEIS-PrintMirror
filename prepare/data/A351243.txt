    "comment": [
        "The conjecture was that every natural number k not divisible by 3 can be written as the quotient of two terms chosen from A147991.",
        "For every specific k, the problem of representing k as the quotient of two terms of A147991 can be decided by using a queue-based breadth-first search algorithm on the transition diagram of a finite automaton that on input j in base 3 computes j*k and checks to see if both j and j*k are in A147991.",
        "It is not known if there are infinitely many counterexamples to the conjecture, but perhaps 3^m+4, for m >= 5 and odd, are."
