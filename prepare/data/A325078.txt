        "Brink showed that prime numbers congruent to 4, 10 or 25 modulo 39 are representable by exactly one of the quadratic forms x^2 + x*y + 10*y^2 or x^2 + x*y + 127*y^2. A325077 corresponds to those representable by the first form, and this sequence corresponds to those representable by the second form."
