        "When we divide the sum by the largest Fibonacci number that divides the sum, we always get a Lucas number."

        "For example, the sum of the first ten Fibonacci numbers is 143. The largest Fibonacci that divides this sum is 13, the seventh Fibonacci number. Thus, as 10 is the fourth triangular number a(4) = 7. After the division we get 143/13 = 11, the fifth Lucas number."
