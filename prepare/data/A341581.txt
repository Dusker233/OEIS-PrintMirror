        "Scorer, Grundy and Smith define a variation of the towers of Hanoi puzzle where the smallest disk moves freely and two disks can exchange positions when they differ in size by 1, are on different pegs, and each is topmost on its peg.  The puzzle is to move a stack of n disks from one peg to another.",
        "Stockmeyer et al. determine the shortest solution to the puzzle.  a(n) is their h(n) which is the number of steps to go from n disks on peg X to the largest disk to peg Y and the others remaining on X.  This arises in A341580 to go between subgraph \"connection\" points."
