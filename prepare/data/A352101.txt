        "This sequence is a variation of A337486; instead of adding to the set all the prime factors of the numbers that cannot be created from the current primes in the set, only add those primes that are missing from the set, i.e., only add enough primes so that the number could then be created from the set. See A337486 for further details."

These numbers add a 2, a 3, another 2 (only one extra 2 is added as 4 = 2*2 and one 2 is already in the set), and a 5. As there is now one 2 and one 3 the number 6 = 2*3 can be created.
