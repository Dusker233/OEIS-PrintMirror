        "Considering the permutation model of graph evolution (see the Flajolet reference) with 2n vertices initially isolated, the probability of the occurrence of an acyclic graph at the critical point n is Pp(n) = A302112(n)/a(2n). Note that a(2n) is the number of labeled graphs with 2n nodes and n edges.",
        "Since a(2n) = C(C(2n, 2), n) we have Pp(n)= A302112(n)/C(C(2n, 2), n).",
        "Therefore, by _Vaclav Kotesovec_'s approximation in A302112, Pp(n) ~ e^(3/4) * P(n), where P(n) = c1 / n^(1/6) is the corresponding probability in the uniform model. Cf. A331500.",
        "If t < n, P(n) is a lower bound of P(t). If t > n, P(n) is an upper bound of P(t). Here P(t) is the probability of an acyclic graph in time t.",
        "Concerning the permutation model, the presence of cycles in graphs evolving near the critical time should be estimated by the above approximation."
