    "comment": [
        "Let x be a length-n binary word, and consider a factorization of the form prod_i w_i^{e_i}, where e_i can be any rational number.  Here w^e means the prefix of www... of length e|w|.  A factorization is minimal if the sum of the |w_i| is minimized, and this is called the (fractional) weight of the word x.  Then a(n) is the maximum, over all length-n binary strings x, of the weight of x."
