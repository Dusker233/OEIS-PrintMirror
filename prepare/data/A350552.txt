        "If p is a prime number of the form p = 4*k + 1 (A002144), then 4*p is a term. Indeed, if p is in A002144, then its binary expansion is of the form b_1_b_2...b_k01, and for 4*p it is b_1_b_2...b_k0100. Because (4*p)' = 4*(p + 1) = 4*p + 4 the binary expansion of the number 4*p + 4 is b_1_b_2....b_k0100 + 100 = b_1_b_2....b_k1000, so with the same number of digits 1."
