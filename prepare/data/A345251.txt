        "The rock crystal is held at the Archeological Museum Patras in Greece, Inv. 1280.",
        "The stone is a grave object of a richly buried boy from Patras, Greece. Maybe it was a token. What is unusual, however, is the sequence of numbers, which in other Dodecad finds is mostly the series of integers from 1 to 12. The care with which the numbers were engraved is also unusual. Maybe there is an arithmetic game or arithmetic puzzle behind it."
