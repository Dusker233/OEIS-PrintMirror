        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one block consisting of the indices (or positions) of the blocks containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}. For an integer partition the T_0 condition means the dual of the multiset partition obtained by factoring each part into prime numbers is strict (no repeated blocks)."
