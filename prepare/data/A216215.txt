        "A string x of length n is (strongly) quasiperiodic if there exists a string w of length < n such that x can be exactly covered by (possibly overlapping) occurrences of w in x.  For example, 01001010 can be covered  by 3 occurrences of 010.  A string is (weakly) superprimitive if it is not strongly quasiperiodic."
