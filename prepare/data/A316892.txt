        "Also the number of unlabeled graphs with n edges, allowing loops, with no equivalent vertices (two vertices are equivalent if in every edge the multiplicity of the first is equal to the multiplicity of the second). For example, non-isomorphic representatives of the a(2) = 3 multigraphs are {(1,2),(1,3)}, {(1,1),(1,2)}, {(1,1),(2,2)}."
