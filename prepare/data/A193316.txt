        "A permutation pi is a forbidden pattern if there is no x in [0,1] such that the values x,f(x),f(f(x)),...,f^{n-1}(x) are in the same relative order as pi_1,pi_2,...,pi_n. A forbidden pattern is basic if it is minimally forbidden, that is, the patterns obtained by removing pi_1 or pi_n are not forbidden.",
