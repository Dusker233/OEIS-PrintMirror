    "comment": [
        "The \"Erase or triple\" protocol describes how to transform an integer K into an integer L: if K has 2 or more identical digits, erase them to get L (1201331 becomes 20); if K has no duplicate digits, triple K to get L (20 becomes 60). Some integers disappear immediately (like 1100 or 9191), other disappear if you apply this protocol to the successive results. This sequence gathers them all.",
        "Note that 1102 is transformed into 2 because no leading zeroes are admitted."
