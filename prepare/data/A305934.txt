It seems nearly certain that no power of 3 containing this many or more decimal digits could have fewer than two '0' digits. (Among numbers of the form 3^k with 73 < k <= 10^7, the only one having fewer than two '0' digits among its final 200 digits is 3^5028978.) - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jun 24 2018",
