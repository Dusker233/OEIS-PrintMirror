        "For odd numbers {5,7,9,11,13,.,k,..} we define the product (k-1)/(k+1) if k == 1 (mod 4), otherwise (k+1)/(k-1). Then (2/3)*(4/3)*(4/5)*(6/5)*(6/7)*(8/7)*... = Pi/4 = 0.78539816339744... < 1, based on the Wallis product. This sequence answers the question, what terms must be deleted such that the product of remaining terms equals 1?.",
        "Since Pi/4 < 1 the terms that must be deleted to make the product equal 1 are all 1 (mod 4). These are the least possible, and apparently their product is Pi/4. The remaining sequence which has product 1 contains more terms that are 3 (mod 4) than 1 (mod 4)."
