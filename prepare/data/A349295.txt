    "name": "a(n) is the number of ordered 6-tuples (a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6) having all terms in {1,...,n} such that there exists a tetrahedron ABCD with those edge-lengths, taken in a particular order (see comments).",

        "Edges with length a_1,a_2,a_3 form a face, a_1 is opposite to a_4, a_2 is opposite to a_5, a_3 is opposite to a_6. If the a_i's are all different, then there are 24 6-tuples corresponding to the same tetrahedron. The tetrahedron is possible iff triangular inequalities hold for every face and the Cayley-Menger determinant is positive. It has been proved that if triangular inequalities hold for at least one face and the Cayley-Menger determinant is positive, then the triangular inequalities for the other three faces hold, too (see article by Wirth, Dreiding in links, (5) at page 165).",
