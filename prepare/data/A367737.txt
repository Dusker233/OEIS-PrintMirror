        "Every primitive Pythagorean quadruple (PPQ) generates a distinct Heronian triangle. This sequence is the area of such a triangle. If a, b, c, d form a PPQ where a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2 it generates a primitive Heronian triangle whose three sides are b^2 + c^2, a^2 + c^2, a^2 + b^2. Its semiperimeter is d^2 and its area is a*b*c*d. It has an inradius and three exradii as a*b*c/d, b*c*d/a, a*c*d/b, a*b*d/c respectively.",
