        "In general, let u(1) = 1, and let k be a positive integer.  Define u(n) = least positive integer not in {u(1), ..., u(n-1), v(1), ..., v(n-1)} and v(n) = n - 1 + k + least positive integer not in {u(1), ..., u(n-1), u(n), v(1), ..., v(n-1)}.  As sets, (u(n)) and (v(n)) are disjoint.  If k >=-1, let a(n) = u(n) and b(n) = v(n) for all n >= 1, but if k <= -2, let a(n) = u(n) - k + 1 and b(n) = v(n) - k -1 for all n >= 1.  Then every positive integer is in exactly one of the sequences (a(n)) and b(n)).  The difference sequence of (a(n)) consists of 1's and 2's; the difference sequence of (b(n)) consists of 2's and 3's. See A335999 for a guide to related sequences."
