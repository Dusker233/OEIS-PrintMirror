        "x is an element of this sequence if when m is the least natural number such that the least positive residue of x mod m! is no more than (m-2)!, floor(x/(m!)) and floor(x/(m*(m!))) are congruent to m-1 mod m, but floor(x/((m^2)*(m!))) is not. The sequence is made up of the residue classes 7 (mod 16); 50 and 104 (mod 162); 364, 366, 748, 750, 1132 and 1134 (mod 1536), etc. A set of such sequences with entries for each zeta(k) - 1 partitions the integers. See the linked paper for their construction."
