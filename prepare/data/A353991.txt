        "See A353876 for further details. All terms are even as a regular polygon with an odd number of edges with all diagonals drawn has only simple interior vertices, i.e. all vertices are created by the crossing of only two lines. Each vertex that creates a 4-sided vertex-surrounding polygon is connected to two other edge vertices as well as the central vertex of this polygon. Such vertices must therefore be created by the crossing of at least three lines, so cannot be vertices of a regular polygon with an odd number of sides."
