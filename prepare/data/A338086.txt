        "Also, numbers whose ternary digit runs are all even lengths (including 0 reckoned as no digits at all).  Also, change ternary digits 0,1,2 to base 9 digits 0,4,8, and hence numbers which can be written in base 9 using only digits 0,4,8.",

        "This sequence is the points on the X=Y diagonal of the ternary Z-order curve (see example table in A163328).  The Z-order curve takes a point number p and splits its ternary digits alternately to X and Y coordinates so X(p) = A163325(p) and Y(p) = A163326(p).  Duplicate digits in a(n) are the diagonal X(a(n)) = Y(a(n)) = n."
