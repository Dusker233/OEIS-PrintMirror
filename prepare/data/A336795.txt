        "For D=73, the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 3 has a solution is 94. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 3 has a solution is 97, but the smallest x in this case is 10, which is less than 94. The next prime, D, after 97 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 3 has a solution is 109 and the least x for which it has a solution is 9532, which is larger than 94, so it is a new record value. 73 is a term of A336794 and 94 is a term of this sequence, but 97 is not a term of A336794 because the least x for which x^2 - 97*y^2 = 3 has a solution is not a record value."
