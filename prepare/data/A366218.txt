        "Equivalently, a(n) is the number of Boolean relation matrices whose Frobenius normal form is such that all the diagonal blocks are primitive (A070322) and all the off diagonal blocks are 0-blocks.  See Gregory, Kirkland, Pullman.",
        "The limit of a convergent binary relation R is an equivalence relation iff every vertex and every edge in G(R) is on a cycle, where G(R) is the directed graph with loops associated to R.  See Corollary to Theorem 1 in Rosenblatt."
