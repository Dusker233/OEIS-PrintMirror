        "The first term > 0 is 902, and we see that 902 is indeed an envelope number as 0 is a multiple of 92; as we want always to insert an envelope number into the biggest next possible envelope, we try first 909, but 909 has no 2-digit divisor; nor could we select 908 (for the same reason), nor 907 (as 907 is prime), nor 906 (as 906 too has no 2-digit divisor), nor 905 or 904 (for the same reason), nor 903 (as 903 would produce the envelope number 29031 which has itself no 2-digit divisor); 902 is ok as 902 has two 2-digit divisors, 11 and 22: we thus keep the biggest one (22) to build a(3) = 29022; a(3) has itself three 2-digit divisors, 14, 21 and 42: we keep the biggest one to build a(4) = 4290222; this number has 16 divisors altogether, but three of them are 2-digit numbers, 17, 34 and 51; we will keep 34 (as 51 cannot produce an infinite sequence) to build a(5) = 342902224, etc.",
        "A way to spare some space in presenting this sequence, would be to align, after a(1) = 0, the successive divisors that are kept; this would form the sequence 0,92,22,42,34,14,66,18,36,54,72,18,63,57,33,89,47,11,21,43,59,47,79,67,61,43,27,27,99,81,19,17,63,27,99,27,27,93,71,59,11,49,11,69,87,39,79,79,91,33,39,43,53,43,11,93,27,51,57,81,81,97,29,99,91,37,37,21,33,69,63,33,39,23,61,51,27,33,23,73,11,67,99,27,27,69,..."
