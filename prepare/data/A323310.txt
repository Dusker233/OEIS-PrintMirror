        "The e-unitary perfect numbers are numbers k such that the sum of their exponential unitary divisors (A322857) equals 2k. The e-semiproper perfect numbers are numbers k such that the sum of their exponential semiproper divisors (A323309) equals 2k. Apparently most of the e-unitary perfect numbers are also e-semiproper perfect numbers: The first 41393 e-unitary perfect numbers are also the first 41393 e-semiproper perfect numbers, but the 41394th e-unitary perfect number is 4769856 which is not e-semiproper perfect. This number, which is the first term of this sequence, was found by Minculete."
