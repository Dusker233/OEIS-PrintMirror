        "This sequence is infinite, in fact 3*2^n is a subsequence because if m = 3*2^n then phi(m-phi(m)) = phi(3*2^n-2^n) = 2^n = phi(m). Also, if p is a Sophie Germain prime greater than 3 then for each natural number n, 2^n*3*p^2 is in the sequence. Note that there exist terms of this sequence like 750 or 2310 that they aren't of either of these forms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Jun 19 2005",
        "If n is an even term greater than 2 in this sequence then 2n is also in the sequence. Because for even numbers m we have phi(2m) = 2*phi(m) so phi(2n) = 2*phi(n) = 2*phi(n-phi(n)) and since n is an even number greater than 2, n-phi(n) is even so 2*phi(n-phi(n)) = phi(2n-2*phi(n)) = phi(2n-phi(2n)) hence phi(2n) = phi(2n-phi(2n)) and 2n is in the sequence. Conjecture: All terms of this sequence are even. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Jul 04 2005",
        "If n is in the sequence and the natural number m divides gcd(n,phi(n)) then m*n is in the sequence. The facts that I have found about this sequence earlier (Jun 19 2005 and Jul 04 2005) are consequences of this. If p is a Sophie Germain prime greater than 3, k>1 and k & n are natural numbers then 2^n*3*p^k are in the sequence. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Dec 10 2005",
