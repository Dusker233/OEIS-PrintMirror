        "It is well known (see Links) that as the hyperexponent of the integer m becomes sufficiently large, the constant convergence speed of m is the number of new stable digits that appear at the end of the result for any further unit increment of the hyperexponent itself, and a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to get this fixed value is to set the hyperexponent equal to m plus 1 (e.g., if n := 3, m = 57 and so 57^^58 has exactly 3 more stable digits at the end of the result than 57^^57)."
