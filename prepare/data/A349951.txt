    "comment": [
        "The sequence has a different pattern if, instead of including integers greater than ten in the description of each block of three, one uses symbols to represent those numbers. For example, in a(7), if the subsequence \"111012101510\" is replaced by \"11A12A15A\" then the interaction of digits with each other is altered."
