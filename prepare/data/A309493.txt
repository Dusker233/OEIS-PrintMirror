        "Is this sequence finite or infinite?",
        "Indeed, from 6486480 to 321253732800, that is, during 41 successive terms (maybe more?), highly Brazilian numbers are the same as highly composite numbers.",
        "The data for this sequence comes from the new terms in the b-file of A066044 found by _Giovanni Resta_.",
        "Why are these six numbers HB (highly Brazilian) and not HC (highly composite)? (See link Why HB and not HC? for more details)",
        "1) For 7, 15 and 40, it is because they have a Brazilian representation with 3 or 4 digits and belong to A326380 (see examples).",
        "2) For 336, 1440 and 5405400, it is because each of these three terms HB r is non-oblong, belong to A326386 and the greatest HC m less than r is oblong with the same number of divisors.",
