        "The return word A = 1 has lambda-image 1, and the return word B = 1234 has lambda-image 1100. This means that they give distances 1, respectively 1 and 3 between (successive) occurrences of 1's in A286749. This leads to the decoration B->13, A->1, which amounts to replacing 0 by 01 and 1 by 0 in the Fibonacci word.",
        "But the Fibonacci word is fixed by the {0,1} version of tau. It follows that the sequence (a(n+1)-a(n)) = 1,3,1,1,3,... is the Fibonacci word on the alphabet {1,3}. Finally, Lemma 8 in the paper \"Generalized Beatty sequences...\" then gives that a(n) = 5*n-2*floor(n*phi)-2, for n>0.",
