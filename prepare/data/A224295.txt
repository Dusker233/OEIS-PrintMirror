        "Conjectured to be the number of permutations of length n avoiding the partially ordered pattern (POP) {2>1>5>3, 5>4} of length 5. That is, conjectured to be the number of length n permutations having no subsequences of length 5 in which the elements 3 and 4 are the smallest, and the element in position 2 is larger than that in position 1, which in turn is larger than the element in position 5.- _Sergey Kitaev_, Dec 13 2020"
