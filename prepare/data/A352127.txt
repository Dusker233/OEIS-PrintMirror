    "comment": [
        "For n > 1, if the set of divisors of an even number m begins with 1, 2, and n odd divisors, then m must be divisible by 2 but not by 4, and its smallest odd divisor > 1 must be a prime p such that m has at least n odd divisors in the interval [p, 2*p-1] (since 2*p will be an even divisor), all of which must be prime (since, if any were composite, then p would not be m's smallest divisor > 1). Thus, the smallest such m is twice the product of the first run of n consecutive primes, the largest and smallest of which have a ratio less than 2."
