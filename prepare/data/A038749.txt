        "In the notation of Nemirovsky et al. (1992), a(n), the n-th term of this sequence is p_{n,m}^{(l)} with m=1 and l=3. These numbers are given in Table II (p. 1093) in the paper. This sequence can be used for the calculation of sequence A047057 via Eq. (5) in the paper by Nemirovsky et al. (1992). (Note that, by equations (7b) in the paper, p_{n,m=1}^{(1)} = 0 for all n >= 1. Also, p_{n,m=1}^{(2)} = A038747(n) for n >= 1.) - _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jan 04 2019"
