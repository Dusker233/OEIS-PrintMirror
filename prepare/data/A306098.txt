        "A plane partition of n is a matrix of nonnegative integers that sum up to n, and such that A[i,j] >= A[i+1,j], A[i,j] >= A[i,j+1] for all i,j. We can consider A of infinite size but there are at most n nonzero rows and columns and we can ignore empty rows or columns. It is symmetric iff A = transpose(A), or A[i,j] = A[j,i] for all i,j.",
        "For any n, we have the total number of plane partitions of n, A000219(n) = A005987(n) + 2*a(n), where A005987 is the number of symmetric plane partitions. For any of the non-symmetric plane partitions, its transpose is a different plane partition of n. So the difference A000219 - A005987 is always even, equal to twice a(n)."
