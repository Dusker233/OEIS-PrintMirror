        "The number of distinct cards in a deck that has each card twice to perform the n-card trick, where the assistant chooses the hidden card. This number corresponds to a particular strategy, where if there is a duplicate card, then the assistant puts one of those duplicates on the far left and hides the other. The assistant then arranges all the other cards in nondecreasing order. If there are no duplicates, the strategy is similar to the standard one."
