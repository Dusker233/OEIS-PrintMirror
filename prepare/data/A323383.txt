        "There are only 7 positive integers which meet this constraint. These happen to be proper divisors of 24. Inductively, there can only be a finite number of integers which meet this constraint. 1 has a perfect tau(k) / k ratio at 1. Every time a j-th power of a prime is multiplied by it, its ratio is multiplied by (j + 1)/p^j. Although 2 also achieves a perfect score, the scores must degrade after 2 because the above ratio is less than 1 otherwise."
