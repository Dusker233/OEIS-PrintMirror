    "name": "For every cell of a polyomino let c be the number of cells that are in the same row or in the same column (including itself). a(n) is the sum of the c values of all cells of all free polyominoes with n cells.",
    "comment": [
        "For a polyomino with n cells the maximum sum possible of the c values equals n^2 = A000290(n) and the minumum sum possible of the c values equals 3*(n - 2) + 4 = A016777(n-1). Hence the difference between the maximum possible and the minimum possible sum of the c values is A000290(n) - A016777(n-1) = A279019(n+3), n >= 1. Also it's equal to A002378(n-1) if n >= 2. See examples.",
        "Note that the concept \"c value\" for a cell or vertex can also be applied in other polyforms and in other types of graphs, for example: cellular automata, partitions, etc.",
        "For another version and further information see A365835, which first differs at a(5)."
