        "An information-theoretic bound on the largest card deck with which one can perform an n-card trick in which the audience chooses two cards to hide.",
        "The bound is based on the following argument: The assistant has (n-2)! ways to arrange the cards. This number can't be smaller than the number of potential guesses by the magician which is binomial(d - n + 2, 2), where d is the deck size."
