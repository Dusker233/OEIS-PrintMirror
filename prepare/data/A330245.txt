        "Paul Erd\u0151s asked whether there are extra-weird numbers n, i.e., numbers n for which sigma(n)/n > 3, but n is not the sum of a subset of its divisors in two ways. Such numbers, if they exist, are in the intersection of A064771 and A068403, and the least of them is a term of this sequence.",
