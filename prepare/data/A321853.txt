        "A 1-dimensional fountain given by a permutation is a 1 X n grid of squares with a source on the left and a sink on the right, where the permutation gives the height of each square of the fountain. Starting from the source, the water fills up each square of the fountain at the rate of one unit volume per unit time. The water immediately flows to all adjacent regions of lower height. The water flows out immediately upon reaching the sink.",
