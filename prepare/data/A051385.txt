There was also the Palmo de c\u00f4vado of 8 polegadas de c\u00f4vado, equal to 34/165 varas, and the Junta do Com\u00e9rcio had established the Palmo da Junta do Com\u00e9rcio of 10 polegadas da Junta, equal to 91/500 varas, for the purpose of standardizing measures used in trade with Portugal's colonies. According to the \"Dictionnaire universel ...\" the palmo used in Brazil was 8 + 7/12 polegada or 103 linha, but this was actually about 12% less than Portugal's palmo. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 21 2018"
