    "comment": [
        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.",
        "The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices.",
        "A multiset partition is intersecting iff no two parts are disjoint. The dual of a multiset partition is intersecting iff every pair of distinct vertices appear together in some part."
