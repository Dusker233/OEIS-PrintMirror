        "The ratio d(k^2)/d(k) is: 1 for the number 1, 3 for numbers of the form p^4*q^2, 5 for numbers of the form p^4*q^2*r^2 (p, q, r being different primes).",

        "All the terms are squares since d(m) is odd if and only if m is a square, so d(k^2) is odd and since d(k)|d(k^2), d(k) is also odd, so k is a square. The ratio d(k^2)/d(k) can take values other than 1, 3, and 5: 1587600 is the least term with a ratio 9, and 192099600 is the least term with a ratio 15. - _Amiram Eldar_, May 23 2020",

        "2) The set of the integer values of the ratio d(k^2)/d(k) is exactly the set of all positive odd integers (see Marcin E. Kuczma reference).",
