        "This is a companion sequence to A295355. The sequence (without exact first and last terms as well as the number of terms) was found by Bays and Hudson in 1978 (see references). The full sequence up to 10^15 contains 6 sign-changing zones with 2381904 terms in total with A(2381904) = 699914738212849 as the last one.",
        "We found the 7th sign-changing zone between 10^15 and 10^16. It starts with A(2381905) = 8744052767229817, ends with A(2792591) = 8772206355445549 and contains 410687 terms. - Andrey S. Shchebetov and _Sergei D. Shchebetov_, Apr 26 2019"
