        "It seems that the fraction of prime gap pairs (g1, g2) for which g1 == 0 (mod 6), satisfying g2 == 0 (mod 6) as well, i.e., a(n)/A340948(n), tends to a constant, say c, when the number of prime gap pairs tends to infinity. From n = 27 we obtain that c > 0.431, while it can be argued heuristically that c < 0.5.",
        "Meanwhile, the fractions of prime gap pairs (g1, g2), satisfying either g2 == 2 (mod 6) or g2 == 4 (mod 6), seem to tend both to another constant, (1-c)/2, when the number of prime gap pairs tends to infinity (see A345333 and A345334)."
