    "comment": [
        "All terms of this sequence are composite numbers.",
        "Note that all positive values of a(n) + 2^i - 2^j are composite from i = 1 to n.",
        "Conjecture: this sequence is infinite and bounded, namely a(n) = K for all n >= N.",
        "If so, then K - 2^j is a Sierpi\u0144ski number for every 1 < 2^j < K, by the dual Sierpi\u0144ski conjecture. Note that each positive value of K + 2^i - 2^j is composite for every i > 0.",
        "The number K can be a (partial) solution to the open problem: are there odd (composite) numbers k such that both |(k -+ 2^m)*2^n +- 1| are composite for every pair of positive integers m,n?",
        "By the dual Sierpi\u0144ski and Riesel conjectures, these are odd numbers k such that both ||k -+ 2^m| +- 2^n| are composite for m, n > 0.",
        "The conditional theorem: by the dual Sierpi\u0144ski conjecture and by the dual Riesel conjecture; if p is an odd prime and m is a positive integer, then there exist two numbers n such that both |(p -+ 2^m)*2^n +- 1| are prime.",
        "So if such numbers k exist, they must be composite."
