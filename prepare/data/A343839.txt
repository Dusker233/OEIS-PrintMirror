    "comment": [
        "There are only these 16 semi-one numbers. That there can only be finitely many is fairly easy to show: consider how many 100-billion-digit numbers have no 1s in them. Eventually the proportion of 1-less numbers drops below 50% and stays there. 5217031 numbers up to 9999999 have a 1 in them so proportion of 1-ful numbers can't drop below 50% for numbers with more digits. Hence the search program can stop at 10 million."
