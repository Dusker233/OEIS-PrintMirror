        "Start with a single regular heptagon. The heptagon fractal is constructed by taking with the previous completed step, and overlapping it in its entirety to each vertex (excluding the top vertex as they overlap completely). Once constructed, any unobscured heptagons within are counted. \"Unobscured\" means no lines cross through it, and its shape is regular. See links for images."
