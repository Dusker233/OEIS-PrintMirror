    "comment": [
        "In the covering case, these degree sequences, sorted in decreasing order, are the same thing as half-loop-graphical partitions (A321729). An integer partition is half-loop-graphical if it comprises the multiset of vertex-degrees of some graph with half-loops, where a half-loop is an edge with one vertex.",

        "(1) the prime indices of n can be partitioned into distinct singletons or strict pairs, i.e., into a set of half-loops or edges;",
        "(2) n can be factored into distinct primes or squarefree semiprimes;",
        "(3) the prime signature of n is half-loop-graphical."
