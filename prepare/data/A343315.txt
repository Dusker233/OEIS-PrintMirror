        "The nonnegative integers are displayed as in A277116.",
        "Given the set S = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, the function f defined in S as f(5) = 4, f(6) = 2 and f(s) = 1 elsewhere, a(n) is equal to the difference between the number b(n) of S-restricted f-weighted integer compositions of n with that of n-6, i.e., b(n-6). The latter one provides the number of all those excluded cases where a nonnegative integer is displayed with leading zeros. b(n) is calculated as the sum of polynomial coefficients or extended binomial coefficients (see Equation 3 in Eger) where the index of summation is positive and it covers the numbers of possible digits that can be displayed by n segments (see third formula)."
