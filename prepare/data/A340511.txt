        "If k is a term, gcd(k,m) = 1, then k*m is again a term. Proof: If G is a group of order k without a subgroup of order k', then G X C_m has no subgroup of order k'*m. Suppose that it has, let G' be that subgroup. For every (a,b) in G', let m_0 be a multiple of m congruent to 1 modulo k, then (a,b)^(m_0) = (a,1) in G'; let k_0 be a multiple of k congruent to 1 modulo m, then (a,b)^(k_0) = (1,b) in G'. This shows that G' itself is of the form H X C_{m'}, where H is a subgroup of G and m' divides m. We have |H|*m' = k'*m, so |H| = k' and m' = m, contradicting with our assumption that G has no subgroup of order k'.",
        "On the other hand, if gcd(k,m) > 1, then k*m need not be a term, as 56 is here but 224 is missing. In fact, N has a proper divisor here but N itself is not in this sequence if and only if N is in A341048. For the \"only if\" part, if N = k*m is a CLT order and k is a NCLT order, then k is a NSS order. Since every multiple of a NSS order is a NSS order, N is a NSS order, so by definition N is in A341048. The \"if\" part follows from MacHale-Manning, 2016, Corollary 13, Page 5.",
        "Conjecture: If k = p^a*q^b, where p, q are primes, q !== 1 (mod p), b >= ord(q,p), then k is a term of this sequence, unless k is an NSS-CLT order of the form described in MacHale-Manning, 2016, Theorem 8, Page 5. Here ord(q,p) is the multiplicative order of q modulo p. Moreover, if k satisfies this condition, it seems that for each NCLT group of order k, the missing orders of subgroups are of the form p^a'*q^b' where either a' = a or b' = b, and a' = a if p == 1 (mod q) or a < ord(p,q).
