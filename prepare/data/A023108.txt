    "comment": [
        "196 is conjectured to be smallest initial term which does not lead to a palindrome. John Walker, Tim Irvin and others have extended this to millions of digits without finding one (see A006960).",
        "Also called Lychrel numbers, though the definition of \"Lychrel number\" varies: Purists only call the \"seeds\" or \"root numbers\" Lychrel; the \"related\" or \"extra\" numbers (arising in the former's orbit) have been coined \"Kin numbers\" by Koji Yamashita. There are only 2 \"root\" Lychrels below 1000 and 3 more below 10000, cf. A088753. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 04 2007",
        "Question: when do numbers in this sequence start to outnumber numbers that are not in the sequence? - _J. Lowell_, May 15 2014",
        "Answer: according to Doucette's site, 10-digit numbers have 49.61% of Lychrels. So beyond 10 digits, Lychrels start to outnumber non-Lychrels. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Oct 12 2015",
        "From the current definition it is unclear whether palindromes are excluded from this sequence, cf. A088753 vs A063048. 9999 would be the first palindromic term that will never result in a palindrome when the Reverse-then-add function A056964 is repeatedly applied. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 13 2019",
        "Empirical observation of the available list shows that every positive integer of the form 99*k-2 such that 1 < k < 9 belongs to the sequence; every positive integer of the form 999*k-1 such that 1 < k < 9 belongs to the sequence except for k=5, which is a palindromic number; every positive integer of the form 9999*k such that 1 < k < 9 belongs to the sequence, and 99999*2+1 belongs to the sequence. Thus, it can be conjectured that every positive integer n in base 10 of the form 999...9*k-m, such that 1 < k < 9, m = 4-j, and j > 1, where j is the number of 9's composing the form of n, is either a palindromic number or belongs to this sequence. - _Juan Moreno Borrallo_, Aug 10 2020",
        "As pointed out by @Mathlove on Mathematics Stack Exchange (see Links section), the above conjecture can be improved to conjecture that some positive integer n in base 10 such that n = (10^j-1)*k - (4-j) and 2 + (j-5)*floor(j/6) <= k <= j + 6 + floor(j/4) is either a palindromic number or belongs to this sequence. - _Juan Moreno Borrallo_, Mar 15 2021"
