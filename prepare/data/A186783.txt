    "comment": [
        "Given an ordered sequence of n elements (1,2,3,...,n), let X represent the permutation that transposes the first two elements, X(1,2,3,...,n) = (2,1,3,...,n), let L be the \"left rotation\" of the sequence, L(1,2,3,...,n) = (2,3,...,n,1), and let R be the \"right rotation\", R(1,2,3,...,n) = (n,1,2,...,n-1). Then every permutation of (1,2,3,...,n) can be expressed as a composition of the permutations X, L and R. One can exhaustively generate such compositions by taking L=\"0\", X=\"1\", R=\"2\", and considering, in turn, base 3 numbers of increasing length (padded with leading zeros). Note that any base 3 number containing the subsequence \"11\", \"02\" or \"20\" may be discarded.",
        "Note also that by defining the distance between any two permutations p and q in S_n, dist(p,q), to be the length of the minimal composition of LXR transforming p into q, we have dist(p,q) = dist(q,p), owing to L and R being mutually inverse, and X being self-inverse."
