        "A064078(a(n)) is a composite number. The sequence has a positive density since it contains, in particular, numbers of the form 8n+20 for n >= 1 (C. Pomerance, private correspondence). Since, e.g., 38 is not in the sequence, there is not an overpseudoprime m such that ord_m(2)=38.",
        "Phi_{a(n)}(2), the a(n)-th cyclotomic polynomial of x evaluated at x=2 has at least 2 distinct prime factors that are not prime factors of the Phi_k(2) for any positive integer k < a(n). For example, Phi_11(2) = 2^11 - 1 = 2047 = 23 * 89 and Phi_25(2) = 2^20 + 2^15 + 2^10 + 2^5 + 1 = 1082401 = 601 * 1801. Note that p = a(n) is prime if and only if Phi_p(2) = 2^p - 1 is composite. - _David Terr_, Sep 09 2018",
        "It is easy to prove the statement above. We use the fact that Phi_j(n) and Phi_k(n) are coprime whenever j and k are coprime as well as the fact that an overpseudoprime has at least 2 distinct prime factors. - _David Terr_, Oct 10 2018",
        "A number k is included iff either 2^k-1 has more than one primitive prime factor (cf. A086251, A161508) or the only primitive prime factor of 2^k-1 is a Wieferich prime (no examples known). - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Sep 01 2020"
