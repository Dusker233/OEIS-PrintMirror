        "Cubic polynomials with no quadratic terms have a poor yield in generating primes compared to quadratic polynomials. This can be seen when comparing the Hardy-Littlewood constants HL for quadratic polynomials of the form x^2 + k (k given in A003521) where HL(x^2 + 1) = 1.3728..., HL (x^2 + 7) = 1.9730..., ..., HL(x^2 + 991027) = 4.1237..., whereas the best known result for the present sequence, a(8) only leads to HL(x^3 + 23602) = 1.7167..."
