        "The sequence is a monoid since it contains 1 and is closed under multiplication, since if m and n are terms, then any prime dividing m or n must be less than log base 2 of m*n. Density: 27% of the numbers from 1 to 64 are terms. From 2^120 +1 to 2^120+64, 0% are terms. However, it is an infinite sequence, since 2^n is always a term, for n>2.",
