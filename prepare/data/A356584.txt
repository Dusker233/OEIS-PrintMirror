    "comment": [
        "At first sight, the number of distinct instances of cardinality n appears to be (n-1)!^n, as an instance may be described as an n X n matrix with the first column fixed, and with each integer between 1 and n appearing once in each line.",
        "However, some distinct instances (with this counting method) only differ by a permutation.",
        "Hence, the establishment of a group action of S_n on A_n, and more specifically the Burnside formula, can be used to count the orbits, so in this specific case the number of instances that are really distinct.",
        "Thus, the sequence gives the number of distinct orbits."
