        "We define a connectedness system to be a set of finite nonempty sets (edges) that is closed under taking the union of any two overlapping edges. It is connected if it is empty or contains an edge with all the vertices. Then a(n) is the number of unlabeled connected connectedness systems without singletons on n vertices. - _Gus Wiseman_, Aug 01 2019"
