        "This is a subset of sequence A351396 with the extra condition that d is included if and only if it is the smallest value of d with a given period. Thus, 246 is included because its period is 5 (repetend is 04065) and it is the first valid of d with this period and, moreover, 5 divides evenly into 245. However, 55 (which is in A351396) is excluded because although its period (2 based on a repetend of 18 for 1/55) divides evenly into 54, there is a smaller value of d (33) with this property and a period of 2 (1/33 has a repetend of 03)."
