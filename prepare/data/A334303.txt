        "The Thue chromatic number of a graph G is the least number k such that there is a nonrepetitive coloring of length k, and no such coloring exists of length < k. (A coloring is nonrepetitive iff there is no path of even length such that the colors in the first half are in the same sequence as the colors in the second half.)",
