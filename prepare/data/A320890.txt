        "The proportion of 0's or 1's in the n-th term approaches 1/2 as n approaches infinity.",
        "Starting with any binary integer apart from 0 or 1 and applying the same process to yield a sequence s(n), we have that, for a sufficiently large x, a(n) is always an initial segment of s(n+x). The constancy and uniqueness of the limiting behavior of initial segments in base 2 is unique among all bases, unless the tally system is considered as a degenerate case."
