        "If 1 is added to each entry and the offset is set to 1 then the resulting sequence can be used to obtain integers in the quadratic number field Q(sqrt(3)) for the two components of the vertices V0_{-k}, as well as V3_{-k}, for k >= 1, of a k-family of ascending regular hexagons. Their centers 0{-k} form part of a discrete hexagon spiral."
