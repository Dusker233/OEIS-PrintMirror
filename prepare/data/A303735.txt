        "The metric dimension of a graph is the least number of nodes needed to characterize uniquely any other vertex by its vector of distances to those nodes. Determining the metric dimension of a general graph is a known NP-complete problem. It is not known, however, whether or not the metric dimension of hypercubes is NP-complete.",
        "The nondecreasing sequence a(n) provides the metric dimension of the n-dimensional hypercube (i.e., with 2^n vertices) for 1 <= n <= 10, computed by brute force. Using an approximation algorithm, Mladenovi\u0107 et al. claim that the next seven terms in the sequence are 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10.",

        "For n = 2, the hypercube has vertices (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), which form a simple cycle. Since each of these nodes has two other nodes at the same distance from it, a(2) >= 2. Using nodes (0,1) and (1,1) to encode all nodes by their distance to these two nodes, we find that (0,0) <-> (1,2); (0,1) <-> (0,1); (1,0) <-> (2,1); and (1,1) <-> (1,0). Since the vectors of distances (1,2), (0,1), (2,1), and (1,0) are all different, a(2) = 2."
