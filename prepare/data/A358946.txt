        "This is a subsequence of A242662, excluding the primitive forms of discriminant 28 with only improper representations of k, like k = 4, 8, 16, 25, 32, ... .",
        "An indefinite binary quadratic primitive form F = a*x^2 + b*x*y + c*y^2 (gcd(a, b, c) = 1) with discriminant Disc = b^2 - 4*a*c = 28 = 2^2*7 is denoted by [a, b, c], or in matrix notation by MF = Matrix([[a, b/2], [b/2, c]]). Hence F = X*MF*X^T (T for transposed), where X = (x, y). See the two links for details and references.",
        "Properly equivalent forms F' and F are related by a matrix R of determinant +1 like MF' = R^T*MF*R, and X'^T = R^{-1}*X^T.",
        "Each primitive form, properly equivalent to the reduced principal form F_p = [1, 4, -3] for Disc = 28 (used in A242662), represents the given nonnegative k = a(n) values (and only these) properly with X = (x, y) and gcd(x, y) = 1. Modulo an overall sign change in X one can choose x nonnegative.",
        "There are 8 = A082174(8) primitive reduced forms of Disc = 28 leading to 2 = A087048(8) (class number) cycles each of period 4, namely the principal cycle CyP = [[1, 4, -3], [-3, 2, 2], [2, 2, -3], [-3, 4, 1]] and the one (with outer signs flipped) CyP' = [[-1, 4, 3], [3, 2, -2], [-2, 2, 3], [3, 4, -1]].",
        "There are A358947(n) representative parallel primitive forms (rpapfs) of discriminant Disc = 28 for k = a(n). This gives the number of proper fundamental representations X = (x, y), with x >= 0, of each primitive form [a, b, c], properly equivalent to the principal form F_p of Disc = 28.",
        "For the negative integers k properly represented by primitive forms [a, b, c] properly equivalent to the principal form of Disc = 28 see A359476. The corresponding number of fundamental proper representations is given in A359477.",
        "This and the three related sequences originated from a proposal by _Klaus Purath_ proving that the form FKP := [1, -2, -6] of Disc = 28 represents k = k(m) = m^2 - 7 = A028881(m), for m >= 3, with the two fundamental representations X1(m) = (m+1, 1) and X2(m) = (11*m - 29, 3*m - 8). This form FKP is properly equivalent to the principal form F_p with R = Matrix([[1, -3], [0, 1]]). Hence all k = a(n) are represented by the form FKP, and A028881 is a subsequence of the present one."
