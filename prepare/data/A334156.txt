        "A length n decorated permutation is a word w = w_1....w_n on the letters {0,...,n} such that the restriction of w to its nonzero entries is an ordinary permutation in one-line notation. Then w avoids 0^m if w contains at most m-1 0's as letters, and w contains 0^m if w contains m 0's among its letters (not necessarily consecutive)."
