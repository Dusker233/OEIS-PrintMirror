    "comment": [
        "The algorithm primex(x) uses an exponent bisection routine and Gram's Riemann approximation, Rg(x) for the prime counting function pi(x). We know that Rg(x) is relatively close to pi(x) as x gets large. We take advantage of this relatively small error noting that pi(prime(x)) = x ~ Rg(prime(x)). A reasonable approximation of prime(x) is x*log(x) while for x = 10^n, often, 10^n*log(10^(n+1)) is a much better approximation. The PARI program shows the flow of this algorithm."
