        "Note that, if there exist infinitely many infinitary perfect numbers (A007357), then, as k tends to infinity over such numbers, A064380(k)/k = 1/2 + o(k^(-1+eps)). We conjecture that here A064380(k)/k = 1/2 infinitely many times, and thus the sequence contains infinitely many infinitary perfect numbers."
