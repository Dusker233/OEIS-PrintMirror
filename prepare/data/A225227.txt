        "A generalization of the well-known \"Nine Dots Problem\", where the regular axis-aligned bounding box (RAABB:=[0, n] X [0, n] X [0, n]) has been declared.",

        "In particular, if we loosen the constraint on the allowed AABB, covering paths characterized by a shorter link-length can be found, such as 5 <= a(2) <= 6, where the aforementioned upper bound has been discovered by Koki Goma in August 2021, providing the self-crossing covering path (0,0,0)-(2,2,0)-(1/2,1/2,3/2)-(2,-1,0)-(0,1,0)-(0,1,1)-(0,0,1).",
        "Moreover, the above pattern suggests different uncrossing covering paths of the same link-length, such as (1,0,0)-(0,0,0)-(2,2,2)-(1/2,-1,1/2)-(-1/2,1,3/2)-(1,1,0)-(1,1,0) and also the (self-crossing) covering path (1,0,0)-(0,0,0)-(0,1,0)-(3/2,1,3/2)-(1/2,-1,1/2)-(-1/2,1,3/2)-(1,1,0) which is entirely contained inside a box of 1.5 X 2 X 2 units^3 but which does not match the RAABB.
