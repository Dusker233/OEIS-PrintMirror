        "Goldbach conjectured that all odd composites are sum of a prime and twice a square. a(9) = 5777 and a(10) = 5993 are the only known exceptions. Elements a(2) .. a(8) are the odd Stern primes (cf. A042978). The next element of the sequence, if it exists, is larger than 10^9. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 16 2007",
