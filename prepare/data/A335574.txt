        "The sequence is a subsequence of A141759.  An alternate description is that for any divisor d <= row(a(k)) - see A235791 - of a(k) = (4n+3)(4n+5) the inequalities d != 4n+3, d != 4n+5 and 2d < 4n+3 hold in addition to 2*(4n+3) > row(a(k)). These conditions state that the symmetric representation of sigma consists of an odd number of regions and that the central region has maximum width 2. With the triangular function T in A235791 we get T[a(k), 4n+3] = T[(4n+3)(4n+5), 4n+3 ] = 2n + 4 and T[a(k), 4n+5] = T[(4n+3)(4n+5), 4n+5 ] = 2n + 1 determining the lengths of the two subparts - see A279387 - as 2*(2n+4) - 1 = 4n + 7 and 2*(2n+1) - 1 = 4n + 1 which results in the pattern [ 3 width 1, (4n + 1) width 2,  3 width 1 ] of unit cells and a total area of 8*(n+1) for the central region. The first region has area 8*(n+1)^2."
