        "The terms with an odd number L = 2k-1 of bits, i.e., 2^(L-1) < a(n) < 2^L, are given by the terms of A033015 with length k, shifted k-1 digts to the left and 'OR'ed with the binary reversal of the term. Terms with an even number L = 2k of digits are given as m*2^k + (binary reversal of m) where m runs over the k-bit terms from A033015 and the k-1 bit terms with the last bit negated appended). This explains the FORMULA for the number of terms of given size. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 17 2022"
