        "Number of discrete implications I:L_n^2->L_n defined on the finite chain L_n={0,1,...,n} satisfying the generalized modus ponens with respect to a discrete t-norm T, i.e., the number of binary functions I:L_n^2->L_n such that I is decreasing in the first argument, increasing in the second argument, I(0,0)=I(n,n)=n and I(n,0)=0 (discrete implication), and T(x,I(x,y))<=y, for all x,y in L_n (generalized modus ponens with respect to a discrete t-norm T). A discrete t-norm T is a binary operator T:L_n^2->L_n such that T is increasing in each argument, commutative (T(x,y)=T(y,x) for all x,y in L_n), associative (T(x,T(y,z))=T(T(x,y),z) for all x,y,z in L_n) and has neutral element n (T(x,n)=x for all x in L_n).",
