Similarly, there is a duality of highest weights [0,0,0,0,1,0] and [0,0,1,0,0,0]. Note that E6 is the only exceptional Lie algebra with such a duality. However this duality is not responsible for all pairs of non-isomorphic irreducible E6 representations of equal dimension--see example.",
        "There are 6 non-isomorphic irreducible E6 representations of dimension 7183313280, and 8 non-isomorphic irreducible E6 representations of dimension 7980534952482277785600. Both dimensions are minimal with respect to that property. I do not know if such dimensions exist for 9 or more irreducible representations."
