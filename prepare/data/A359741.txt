        "The walks counted are all those directly along and x, y or z axes, and all walks whose final (x,y,z) lattice point is a solution to the Pythagorean quadruple x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = t^2. The first such solution with all coordinates > 0 is 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 3^2, which explains the large increase in the number of walks from a(4) to a(5)."
