        "_Allan C. Wechsler_ remarks that one can derive larger terms from existing terms. For instance, k = 5552064 has q = k/A097621(k) = 18. So multiplying 5552064 by 31 = A000961(18) will give a new term with q = 31.",
        "More precisely, if k = a(n) has q = A343886(k) and m = A000961(q) such that gcd(k, m) = 1, then k*m is also a term. We could call \"primitive\" those terms not derived from a smaller term in this way. All the listed terms are primitive, but a({35, 36, 38, 42, 43}) allow the sequence to be extended to five larger non-primitive terms. The second and fourth one, having q = 17 resp. q = 23, both lead to a whole chain of many new terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 15 2021"
