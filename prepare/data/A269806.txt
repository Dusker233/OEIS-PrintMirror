        "To define (harmonic) fractility of an integer m > 1, we first define nested interval sequences.  Suppose that r = (r(n)) is a sequence satisfying (i) 1 = r(1) > r(2) > r(3) > ... and (ii) r(n) -> 0.  For x in (0,1], let n(1) be the index n such that r(n+1) < x <= r(n), and let L(1) = r(n(1)) - r(n(1)+1).  Let n(2) be the largest index n such that x <= r(n(1)+1) + L(1)*r(n), and let L(2) = (r(n(2))-r(n(2)+1))*L(1).  Continue inductively to obtain the sequence (n(1), n(2), n(3), ... ) =: NI(x), the r-nested interval sequence of x.",
        "For fixed r, call x and y equivalent if NI(x) and NI(y) are eventually identical.  For m > 1, the r-fractility of m is the number of equivalence classes of sequences NI(k/m) for 0 < k < m.  Taking r = (1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...) gives harmonic fractility.",
        "In the case of harmonic fractility, r(n) = 1/n, we have n(j+1) = floor(L(j)/(x -Sum_{i=1..j} L(i-1)/(n(i)+1))) for j >= 0, L(0) = 1. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 05 2018"
