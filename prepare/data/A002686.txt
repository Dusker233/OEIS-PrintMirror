        "This is the secondary main diagonal of A324124 (which is essentially Table I on p. 217 in Luke (1952)), except that a(7) = 1603182 must be replaced with 1603182/7 = 229026. This is necessary to give a unique definition to the terms of A324124. For more information, see the comments for A324124.",
        "Luke (1952) is not wrong (since 1603182/4054050 = 229026/579150), but his integers for the case n = 7 have to modified as mentioned in the documentation of array A324124. For an improved version of this sequence, see A328885. (End)"
