        "Since tau(k) + tau(k+1) + tau(k+2) = 10 and no three consecutive integers include more than one square, the triple (tau(k), tau(k+1), tau(k+2)) must consist of three even numbers, so it must be one of (2, 2, 6), (2, 4, 4), (2, 6, 2), (4, 2, 4), (4, 4, 2), and (6, 2, 2). Of these, (2, 2, 6) and (6, 2, 2) are impossible. Of the remaining patterns:",
