        "Intervals extending to hundreds of integers with exactly 50% membership of this sequence are far from rare, some notable examples being [3000, 3999], [8000, 8999], [20000, 20999], [21000, 21999] and [23000, 23999]. This reflects the asymptotic density of the corresponding set being close to 0.5, precisely 1847 / 3675 = 0.50258503... (and membership of the set has a periodic pattern).
