        "As '2 is prime' and also '2 is one less than prime 3' (see A173919), there exist two subsequences with k = 2 elements in these APs of primes (see examples).",
        "1. If d is an odd term, then d is in A040976 \\ {0} with d = prime(m) - 2, for some m >= 2, and, for each such d, there exists only one longest possible AP of primes, and this AP is always: (2, prime(m)) = (2, d+2), so starts with 2. This subsequence corresponds to the first case: '2 is prime'.",
        "2. If d is an even term, then d is in A360735 and the longest corresponding APs of primes are of the form (q, q+d) with q odd primes. This subsequence corresponds to the second case '2 is one less than prime 3'.",
