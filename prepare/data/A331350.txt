        "A 4-dimensional simplex has 5 vertices and 10 edges. Its Schl\u00e4fli symbol is {3,3,3}. Two oriented colorings are the same if one is a rotation of the other; chiral pairs are counted as two.",
        "There are 60 elements in the rotation group of the 4-dimensional simplex. Each is an even permutation of the vertices and can be associated with a partition of 5 based on the conjugacy group of the permutation. The first formula is obtained by averaging their cycle indices after replacing x_i^j with n^j according to the P\u00f3lya enumeration theorem.",
