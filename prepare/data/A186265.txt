        "Let u(1)=1 and u(n)=abs(u(n-1)-gcd(u(n-1),n+f(n)) where f(n) is a periodic sequence with period [f(1),f(2),...,f(beta)]. Then (b_f(k))_{k>=1} is the sequence of integers such that u(b_f(k))=0. We conjecture that for k large enough b_f(k)+1+f(i) is simultaneously prime for i=1,2,...,beta. Here for f(k)=(-1)^k it appears a(n) and a(n)+2 are twin primes for n>=7. If we start with u(1) large enough (such as with u(1)=71) the sequence will produce only twin primes."
