        "Among a(1) to a(30), only a(23) = 13123110 has multiplicity 3, the others have multiplicity 2. The three primitive Pythagorean triangles corresponding to a(23) are [4485, 5852, 7373], [3059, 8580, 9109] and [19019, 1380, 19069]. Leg exchange is not taken into account. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 15 2015",
