A276086 will convert such a number to a number of the form p_k^e_k * ... * 7^b * 5^a * 3^{1,2} * 2^0 (an odd multiple of three, thus of the form 6k+3) which in primorial base will end with digits \"11\", thus on the second iteration A276086 will convert that to a number of the form p_k^e_k * ... * 7^b * 5^a * 3^1 * 2^1, with the least missing prime having an index (A257993) at least 3, which is larger than the original 1.
