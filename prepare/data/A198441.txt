        "This sequence gives the sum of the two legs (catheti) x + y of primitive Pythagorean triangles (x,y,z) with y even and gcd(x,y) = 1, ordered nondecreasingly (with multiple entries). See A058529(n), n>=2, for the sequence without multiple entries. For the proof, put in the Zumkeller link w = x + y, v = z and u = abs(x - y). This works because w^2 - v^2 = v^2 - u^2, hence u^2 = 2*v^2 - w^2 = 2*z^2 - (x+y)^2 = 2*(x^2 + y^2) - (x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*y = (x-y)^2. The primitivity of the arithmetic progression triples follows from the one of the Pythagorean triples: gcd(u,w) = 1 follows from gcd(x,y) = 1, then gcd(u,v,w) = gcd(gcd(u,w),v) = 1. The converse can also be proved: given a primitive arithmetic progression triple (u,v,w), 1 <= u < v < w, gcd(u,v,w) = 1, the corresponding primitive Pythagorean triple with even y is ((w-u)/2,(w+u)/2,v) or ((w+u)/2,(w-u)/2,v), depending on whether (w+u)/2 is even or odd, respectively. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, May 22 2013",
