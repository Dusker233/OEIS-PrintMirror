        "This sequence has a an asymptotic density (Matom\u00e4ki et al., 2016). The numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k, for k = 1, 2, ..., are 5, 26, 274, 2673, 26909, 267872, 2680091, 26810993, 268098678, 2680989431, 26809725312, ... . This empirically indicates that the density is 0.26809... . This sequence is a disjoint union of A068781 whose density is 1 - 2 * A059956 + A065474, and the subsequence of A007674 of terms k with mu(k) and mu(k+1) having opposite signs. Assuming that this subsequence has a density which is exactly half the density of A007674, we get that this sequence has the density 1 - 12/Pi^2 + (3/2)*A065474 = 0.2680969447... . - _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 09 2022"
