        "An H-toothpick sequence is a toothpick sequence on a square grid that resembles a partial honeycomb of hexagons.",
        "The structure has two types of elements: the classic toothpicks with length 1 and the \"D-toothpicks\"  with length sqrt(2).",
        "Classic toothpicks are placed in the vertical direction and D-toothpicks are placed in a diagonal direction.",
        "Each hexagon has area = 4.",
        "The network looks like an elongated hexagonal lattice placed on the square grid so that all nodes of the hexagonal net coincide with some of the grid points of the square grid. Each node in the hexagonal network is represented with coordinates x,y.",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks after n steps. A182839 (first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage.",
        "[It appears that for this sequence a classic toothpick is a line segment of length 1 that is parallel to the y-axis. A D-toothpick is a line segment of length sqrt(2) with slope +-1. D stands for diagonal. It also appears that classic toothpicks are not placed on the y-axis. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 06 2023]",

        "- The elements (toothpicks and D-toothpicks) are connected at their ends.",
        "- At each free end of the elements of the old generation two elements of the new generation must be connected.",
        "- The toothpicks of length 1 must always be placed vertically, i.e. parallel to the Y-axis.",
        "- The angle between a toothpick of length 1 and a D-toothpick of length sqrt(2) that share the same node must be 135 degrees, therefore the angle between two D-toothpicks that share the same node is 90 degrees.",
        "As a result of these rules we can see that in the odd-indexed rows of the structure are placed only the toothpicks of length 1 and in the even-indexed rows of the structure are placed the D-toothpicks of length sqrt(2).",
