        "Cyclic compositions of a positive integer n are equivalence classes of ordered partitions of n such that two such partitions are equivalent iff one can be obtained from the other by rotation. These were first studied by Sommerville (1909).",
        "Symmetric cyclic compositions or circular palindromes or achiral cyclic compositions are those cyclic compositions that have at least one axis of symmetry. They were also studied by Sommerville (1909, pp. 301-304).",
        "Dihedral compositions of a positive integer n are equivalence classes of ordered partitions of n such that two such partitions are equivalent iff one can be obtained from the other by rotation or reflection. See, for example, Knopfmacher and Robbins (2013).",
        "The number of dihedral compositions of n (of any kind) is the average of the corresponding numbers of cyclic and symmetric cyclic compositions of n.",
        "Let c = (c(m): m >= 1) be the input sequence and let b_k = (b_k(n): n >= 1) be the output sequence under Bower's DIK[k] (\"bracelet, indistinct, unlabeled\" with k boxes) transform of c; that is, b_k(n) = (DIK[k] c)_n for n >= 1. Hence, b_k(n) is the number of dihedral compositions of n with k parts, where a part of size m can be colored with one of c(m) colors. If C(x) = Sum_{m >= 1} c(m)*x^m is the g.f. of the input sequence c, then the bivariate g.f. of the list of sequences (b_k: k >= 1) = ((DIK[k] c): k >= 1) = ((b_k(n): n >= 1): k >= 1) is Sum_{n,k >= 1} b_k(n)*x^n*y^k = (1 + y * C(x))^2/(4 * (1 - y^2 * C(x^2))) - (1/4) - (1/2) * Sum_{d >= 1} (phi(d)/d) * log(1 - y^d * C(x^d)).",
        "Here, Sum_{k=1..n} k*b_k(n) is the total number of parts in all colored dihedral compositions of n (where the coloring of parts is done according to the input sequence c). To find the g.f. of the sequence (Sum_{k=1..n} k*b_k(n): n >= 1), we differentiate the above bivariate g.f. (i.e., Sum_{n,k >= 1} b_k(n)*x^n*y^k) w.r.t. y and set y = 1. We get (1 + C(x)) * (C(x) + C(x^2))/(2 * (1 - C(x^2))^2) + (1/2) * Sum_{d >= 1} phi(d) * C(x^d)/(1 - C(x^d)).",
        "For the current sequence, the input sequence is c(m) = m for m >= 1, and we are dealing with the so-called \"m-color\" compositions. m-color linear compositions were studied by Agarwal (2000), whereas m-color cyclic compositions were studied by Gibson (2017) and Gibson et al. (2018).",
        "Thus, for the current sequence, a(n) is the total number of parts in all m-color dihedral compositions of n (where a part of size m may be colored with one of m colors). Since C(x) = x/(1 - x)^2, we get that (1 + C(x)) * (C(x) + C(x^2))/(2 * (1 - C(x^2))^2) + (1/2) * Sum_{d >= 1} phi(d) * C(x^d)/(1 - C(x^d))  = (1/2) * (x^2 - x + 1) * x * (x^2 + 3*x + 1) * (x + 1)^2/((x^2 + x - 1)^2 * (x^2 - x - 1)^2) + (1/2) * Sum_{s >= 1} phi(s) * x^s/(1 - 3*x^s + x^(2*s))."
