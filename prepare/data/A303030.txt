        "For n >= 1, a(n) is also the number of hydronitrogen molecules containing only n nitrogen trivalent (octet rule satisfying) atoms. So for example, diazene is counted but hydrazoic acid is not because the former has only trivalent nitrogens and the latter has two non-trivalent nitrogens.",
        "Some of the molecules are theoretical and may or may not exist due to their strained geometries.",

        "This is the case since A243391 gives the number of loopless multigraphs with nodes of degree 3 or less. The extra graph in A243391 is the 3-regular graph on 2 nodes. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 20 2020"
