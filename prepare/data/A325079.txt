        "Brink showed that prime numbers congruent to 1, 16, 26, 31 or 36 modulo 55 are representable by both or neither of the quadratic forms x^2 + x*y + 14*y^2 and x^2 + x*y + 69*y^2. This sequence corresponds to those representable by both, and A325080 corresponds to those representable by neither."
