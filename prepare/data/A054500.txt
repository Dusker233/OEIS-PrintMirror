    "comment": [
        "The three sequences A054500/A054501/A054502 are used to classify solutions to the problem of \"Nonattacking queens on a 2n+1 X 2n+1 toroidal board\" by their symmetry; solutions are considered equivalent iff they differ only by rotation, reflection or torus shift.",
        "For brevity, let i(n) = A054500(n) (indicator sequence), m(n) = A054501(n) (multiplicity) and c(n) = A054502(n) (count).",
        "i(n) = k means that there are solutions for the kXk board and that m(n) and c(n) refer to it. There are c(n) inequivalent solutions which may be extended to m(n) different representations each (i.e. m(n) permutations).",
        "This gives two formulas: A007705(n) = Sum (c(k) * m(k)), A053994(n) = Sum (c(k)), where the sum is taken over all k for which i(k) = 2n+1, for both formulas. Note that m(n) is always a divisor of 8 * i(n)^2."
