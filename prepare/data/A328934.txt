        "If N is squarefree then A328919(N) = 1, but the converse is not true. While it is conjectured that 12 is the only N such that 0 = A328919(N) < A051903(N), there are infinitely many N such that 1 = A328919(N) < A051903(N).",
        "Let p_1, p_2, ..., p_(k-1) be k-1 distinct odd primes, k >= 3. Let N = 2^k*p_1*p_2*...*p_(k-1), then N is here. It is easy to see that {sigma_t(N) mod 2^k: t >= k} and {sigma_t(N) mod p_i: t >= 1} are both purely periodic.",

This is divisible by 2^k if and only if 2^k | Sum_{d|M} (2d)^t, or 2^(k-t) | sigma_t(M). This is obvious because sigma_t(p_i) is even, as sigma_t() is multiplicative, 2^(k-1) | sigma_t(M).",
