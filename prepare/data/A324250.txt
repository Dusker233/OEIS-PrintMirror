        "The indefinite binary quadratic form F(n,x,y) = x^2 - 3*m(n)*x*y + y^2 = [1, -3*m(n), 1] representing -m(n)^2 with m(n) = A002559(n), determines Markoff triples MT(n) = (x(n) = A305313(n), y(n) = A305314(n), m(n)) with x(n) < y(n) < m(n), for n >= 3. For n = 1 and 2: x(n) = y(n) = 1. The Frobenius-Markoff conjecture is that this solution is unique. This form F(n,x,y) has discriminant D(n) = (3*m(n))^2 - 4 = a(n)*(a(n) + 4) = A305312(n) > 0.",
        "Because -3*m(n) < 0  this form F(n,x,y) is not reduced (see e.g., the Buell reference, or the W. Lang link in A225953 for the definition).",
        "The principal reduced form for F(n,x,y) is prF(n,X,Y) = X^2 + a(n)*X*Y - a(n)*Y^2  = [1, a(n), -a(n)]. (See, e.g., Lemma 2 of the W. Lang link in A225953 where  b = a(n), f(D(n)) = ceiling(sqrt(D(n))) = 3*m(n), and D(n) and f(D(n)) have the same parity.) The relation between these forms is F(n,Y,Y-X) = prF(n,X,Y) with Y > 0, Y-X > 0, and X <= 0 (for n >= 3, X < 0)."
