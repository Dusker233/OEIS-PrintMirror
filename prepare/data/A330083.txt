        "This list is complete. Proof: When converting base 2 to base 4, we can group the digits in base 2 into pairs from the least significant bit. We then convert pairs into single digits in base 4 as 00 -> 0, 01 -> 1, 10 -> 2, 11 -> 3. This always causes the number of zeros to go to half or less than half. For all n >= 7, n-4 is greater than (n-2)/2, so the condition is impossible. - _Christopher Cormier_, Dec 08 2019",
