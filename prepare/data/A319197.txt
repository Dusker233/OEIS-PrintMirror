    "comment": [
        "It appears that Fibonacci(2^(n-2)*3*m)/(2^n) is a nonnegative integer for n >= 3 and all m >= 0. The remaining factor for n >= 3 is given by A(n) := Product_{j=3..n} a(j). For n = 3 and 4 see A049660 and A253368, respectively. Thus the conjecture is that I(n; m) := Fibonacci(2^(n-2)*3*m) / ((2^n)*A(n)) is a nonnegative integer for all m >= 0. This is best possible for all m (because for m = 1 this becomes 1); special m may allow more factors. E.g., n = 3: 8 | Fibonacci(6*m), for all m >= 0, but for even m larger powers of 2 than 2^3 appear; for m = 0 any power of 2.",
