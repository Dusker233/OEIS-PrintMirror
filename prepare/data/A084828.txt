        "a(4) and a(5) are experimental values. Although A121346(5) claims a lower bound of a(5)=68, it is conjectured from extensive numerical search that this value is unachievable and therefore a(5)=67.",
        "The conjecture a(5)=67 was proved wrong by Yu Liang, who found an arrangement of 68 spheres of radius 1 fitting into a sphere of radius 5."
