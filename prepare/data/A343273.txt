        "The term \"regular\" applies only to the regular n-gon and 2n-gon (the \"top and bottom\" of the cupola), the other faces (the \"sides\") being n isosceles triangles and n sufficiently long rectangles. For n=3,4,5, regular triangles and squares can be used for the sides. That applies to n=6 if a two-sided (flat) polyhedron is allowed.",
