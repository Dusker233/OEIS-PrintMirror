        "Primes p such that 3 or -3 (or both) is a primitive root modulo p. Proof of equivalence: let ord(a,k) be the multiplicative order of a modulo p. if ord(3,p) = p-1, then clearly ord(9,p) = (p-1)/2. If ord(-3,p) = p-1, then we also have ord(9,p) = (p-1)/2. Conversely, suppose that ord(9,p) = (p-1)/2, then ord(3,p) = p-1 or (p-1)/2, and ord(-3,p) = p-1 or (p-1)/2. If ord(3,p) = ord(-3,p) = (p-1)/2, then we have that (p-1)/2 is odd and (-1)^((p-1)/2) == 1 (mod p), a contradiction.",
