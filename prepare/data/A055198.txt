        "_Sean A. Irvine_ noted on Mar 14, 2022, that the sequence had more than the previously described 54 terms less than 1000. Specifically, the combined and sorted 22 length-90 iterations for odd starting integers from 1011 to 1053 follow. In fact, it appears that the 22 length-[2*10^(n+1)-110] iterations for odd starting integers from 10^(2*n+1)+11 to 10^(2*n+1)+53 are, for positive n, all terms. - _Hans Havermann_, Mar 18 2022",
        "There are no 5-digit terms. Looking through 6-digit integers one finds that, in addition to the above-mentioned 22 length-1890 cycles, there are 449 length-450 cycles (224 odd starting integers from 100101 to 100547, 113 alternate-odd starting integers from 100551 to 100999, and 112 alternate-odd starting integers from 110111 to 110555) and 2 length-225 cycles (for starting integers 100549 and 110559). Added to the existing 2034-term b-file makes for 246114 terms less than one million. Beyond one million one must contend with potentially long runs before entering a cycle. For example, 1001011 requires 25037505 iterations to reach the term 100021. - _Hans Havermann_, Apr 08 2022"
