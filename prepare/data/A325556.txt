        "A necklace composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n that is lexicographically minimal among all of its cyclic rotations.",
        "The circular differences of a composition c of length k are c_{i + 1} - c_i for i < k and c_1 - c_i for i = k. For example, the circular differences of (1,2,1,3) are (1,-1,2,-2)."
