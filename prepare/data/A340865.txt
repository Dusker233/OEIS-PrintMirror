        "The k-th triangular number T(k) = A000217(k) = k*(k+1)/2 can be written as the product of two coprime factors A and B where A=k and B=(k+1)/2 for odd k, A=k/2 and B=k+1 for even k. If a triangular number has 6 divisors, then it is of the form p^2*q where p and q are distinct primes. We can identify four cases:",
        "Case 1: A = k = p^2 and B = (k+1)/2 = q, so q = (p^2 + 1)/2; solutions occur at primes p in A048161.",
        "Case 2: A = k = q and B = (k+1)/2 = p^2, so 2*p^2 - 1 = q; solutions occur at primes p in A106483.",
        "Case 3: A = k/2 = p^2 and B = k+1 = q. In this case, 2*p^2 + 1 = q. For p = 2, we would get q = 9 (nonprime), so p must be odd. If prime p > 3 (so q > 19), we have p^2 == 1 (mod 3), so q == 0 (mod 3), hence nonprime. So the only solution for this case occurs at p=3, q=19, t = 3^2*19 = 171.",
        "Case 4: A = k/2 = q and B = k+1 = p^2. In this case, 2*q + 1 = p^2, so p is odd, but then p^2 == 1 (mod 8), so q == 0 (mod 4), hence q is not prime: no solutions exist.",
        "Since Case 4 has no solutions, at most three triangular numbers with 6 divisors can be divisible by the same squared prime p^2; Case 3 has a solution only at p=3 and, in fact, there are three triangular numbers with 6 divisors that are divisible by 3^2: t = 3^2*5 = 45 = T(9), t = 3^2*17 = 153 = T(17), and 3^2*19 = 171 = T(18).",
