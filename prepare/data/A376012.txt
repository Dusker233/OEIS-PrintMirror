    "comment": [
        "Number of ways any integer is a product of n superparticular ratios, without regard to order.  A superparticular ratio is a ratio of the form (m+1)/m."

    "example": [
        "For n = 2, a(2) = 3, three solutions, {x_1, x_2} = {2, 3} = 2; {1, 2} = 3; {1, 1} = 4.",
        "In other words, a(2) = 3 since 2 can be written as (3/2)(4/3), 3 can be written as (2/1)(3/2), and 4 can be written as (2/1)^2, but no other integers are the product of two superparticular ratios.",
        "a(3) = 12 since 2 can be written in 5 ways, 3 can be written in 3 ways, and 4, 5, 6, and 8 can be written in 1 way each, as the product of three superparticular ratios."
