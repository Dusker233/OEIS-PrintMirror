        "In a permutation of [n] that contains the shuffle pattern s-k-t, where s = 123 and t = 132, k should be greater than the numbers in pattern s and the numbers in pattern t. (The numbers in each of the patterns s and t should be contiguous.) Clearly, for n = 0..6, all permutations of [n] avoid this shuffle pattern (since we need at least seven numbers to get this pattern). Hence, a(n) = n! for n = 0..6.",
        "For n = 7, k should be equal to 7, and for the pattern s = 123 we have binomial(6,3) = 20 choices: 123, 124, 125, ..., 456. The corresponding permutations of [7] that contain this shuffle pattern are 1237465, 1247365, 1257364, ..., 4567132. Thus, a(7) = 7! - 20 = 5020. (End)"
