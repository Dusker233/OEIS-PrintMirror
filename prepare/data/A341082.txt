        "For D=19, the least positive y for which x^2-D*y^2=5 has a solution is 2. The next prime, D, for which x^2-D*y^2=5 has a solution is 29, but the smallest positive y in this case is 2, which is equal to the previous record y. So, 29 is not a term.",
        "The next prime, D, after 19 for which x^2-D*y^2=5 has a solution is 61 and the least positive y for which it has a solution is y=58, which is larger than 2, so it is a new record y value. So 61 is a term of A341081 and 58 is a term of this sequence."
