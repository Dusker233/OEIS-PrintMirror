Zoom in to see the vertices marked as white dots around the 14-gon, shown in violet. The bottom three vertices are extremely close together -- if the image were expanded so that the outer two of these vertices were 1 cm away from the inner vertex then the size of the entire 211-gon image would be slightly over 3.5 km in diameter."
