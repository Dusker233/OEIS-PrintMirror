Since M(1,d+1-j) = n/M(1,j) for 1 <= j <= d, we have M(i,d+2-i-j) = M(i,j) for even i, 1 <= j <= d+1-i, and M(i,d+2-i-j) = 1/M(i,j) for odd i > 1, 1 <= j <= d+1-i. If n is a square, then d is odd, so M(d,1) = 1/M(d,1) => M(d,1) = 1. This shows that all square numbers are terms. Note that all powers of primes (A000961) are trivially terms. It seems that the squares and the powers of primes are the only terms. - _Jianing Song_, Jan 03 2023"
