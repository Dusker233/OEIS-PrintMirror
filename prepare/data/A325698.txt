The sequence is closed under multiplication, prime shift (A003961), and - where the result is an integer - under division. Using these closures, all the terms can be derived from the presence of 6. For example, A003961(6) = 15, A003961(15) = 35, 6 * 35 = 210, 210/15 = 14. Closed also under A297845, since A297845 can be defined using squaring, prime shift and multiplication. - _Peter Munn_, Oct 05 2020"
