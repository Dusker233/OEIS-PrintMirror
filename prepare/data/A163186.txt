        "Such primes are the exceptional p for which x^64 == -2 (mod p) has a solution, as x^64 == -2 (mod p) is soluble for *every* p with ord_p(-2) odd.",
        "But if ord_p(-2) is even and p - 1 = 2^r.j with j odd, then x^64 == -2 (mod p) is soluble if and only if ord_p(-2) is not divisible by 2^(r-5). See comment at A163185 for explanation.",
        "Most primes p for which x^64 == -2 (mod p) has a solution (A051101) have ord_p(-2) odd (so belong to A163183). Thus 25601 (first element of current sequence, and 827th element of A051101) is the first element where A051101 and A163183 differ."
