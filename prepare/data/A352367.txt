        "a(n) is the number of chordal graphs with fixed symmetric perfect elimination ordering; i.e., graphs on V = [n] such that 1,...,n and n,...,1 are perfect elimination orderings. - _Robert Lauff_, Jan 25 2023",
        "a(n) is the number of labeled unit-interval-graphs. This is because connected labeled unit-interval-graphs are a Catalan family. Given a partition of [n], we draw a connected unit-interval-graph for each of the partition classes. This weights the partitions with a Catalan number. The connection to my previous comment can be shown by induction. - _Robert Lauff_, Feb 01 2023"
