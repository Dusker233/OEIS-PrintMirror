        "Original definition (edited): In a(n), the last digit must be seen as a glyph and preceding digits as a number, counting occurrences of the glyph up to and including a(n). \"10\" reads [one '0'] and \"12\" [one '2'] - which are both true statements: there is one '0' glyph so far in the sequence when 10 is read and there is one '2' glyph when 12 is read. The sequence is built with a(n+1)-a(n) being minimal, positive, and a(n) always \"true so far\". This explains why there are no integers 11, 21, 22, 31 etc.: their statements are false.",
