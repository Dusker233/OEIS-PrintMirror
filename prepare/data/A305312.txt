This is the form x^2 - 3*m*x*y + y^2 = -m^2 (with dropped argument n), or in reduced version  X^2 + b*X*Y - b*Y^2 = -m^2, with b = b(n) = 3*m(n) - 2, where X = X(n) = y(n) - x(n) and  Y = Y(n) = y(n). The uniqueness of such Markoff triples MT(n) with given largest members m(n) is a conjecture.",
        "To find reduced forms one needs f(n) := ceiling(sqrt(D(n))) which is  3*m(n) because (3*m-1)^2 < 9*m^2 - 4 < (3*m)^2, due to 6*m(n) > 5, for n >= 1.",
