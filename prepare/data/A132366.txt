        "a(n-1) is the number of achiral colorings of the 5 tetrahedral facets (or vertices) of a regular 4-dimensional simplex using n or fewer colors. An achiral arrangement is identical to its reflection. The 4-dimensional simplex is also called a 5-cell or pentachoron. Its Schl\u00e4fli symbol is {3,3,3}.",
        "There are 60 elements in the automorphism group of the 4-dimensional simplex that are not in its rotation group. Each is an odd permutation of the vertices and can be associated with a partition of 5 based on the conjugacy class of the permutation. The first formula for a(n-1) is obtained by averaging their cycle indices after replacing x_i^j with n^j according to the P\u00f3lya enumeration theorem.",
