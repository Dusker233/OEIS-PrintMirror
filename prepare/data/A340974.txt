    "name": "The sum of the numbers on straight lines of incrementing length n when drawn over numbers of the square spiral, where each line contains numbers which sum to the minimum possible value, and each number on the spiral can only be in one line. If two or more lines exist with the same sum the one containing the smallest number is chosen.",
    "comment": [
        "The upper and left segments of the spiral contain most of the lines, with the bottom segment containing significantly fewer. Up to 500 lines the only two in the right segment are a(1) = 5 and a(3) = 46. It is unknown if any more appear. The list of numbers that are definitely never covered starts 4,8,9,14,15,16. Whether the next lowest are 38,39,40,... or 27,28,29,... is currently unknown as that is dependent on the existence of further vertical or horizonal lines in the right segment.",
        "Up to 500 lines the only occurrence of two lines with the same sum is a(5) = 171. See the examples below. In this instance if the line with the higher numbers is instead chosen then the value for a(6) becomes 273 but otherwise all other lines and sums are identical to the current sequence."
