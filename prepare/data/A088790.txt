        "Note that (k^k-1)/(k-1) is prime only if k is prime, in which case it equals cyclotomic(k,k), the k-th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at x=k. This sequence is a subsequence of A070519. The number cyclotomic(7547,7547) is a probable prime found by H. Lifchitz. Are there only a finite number of these primes?",
        "From _T. D. Noe_, Dec 16 2008: (Start)",
        "The standard heuristic implies that there are an infinite number of these primes and that the next k should be between 10^10 and 10^11.",
        "Let N = (7547^7547-1)/(7547-1) = A023037(7547). If N is prime, then the period of the Bell numbers modulo 7547 is N. See A054767. (End)"
