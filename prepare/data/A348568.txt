        "These are all the terms in the sequence because for a number x that has exponents of 2 and 3 equal and >= 5 in its prime factorization, 8x/9 is a smaller number with at least the same number of divisors. Since 1516237305382800 is the greatest highly composite number that is not a multiple of 32, A134592(32), it is the last term of this sequence."
