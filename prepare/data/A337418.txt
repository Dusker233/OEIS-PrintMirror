    "comment": [
        "The Hausdorff metric defines a distance between sets. Using this distance we can define line segments with sets as endpoints. Create two sets from the vertices of the parts A and B (with |A| = 3) of a complete bipartite graph K(3,n) (with n at least 3) missing two edges, where the removed edges are not incident to the same vertex in A but are incident to the same vertex in B. Points in the sets A and B that correspond to vertices that are connected by edges are the same Euclidean distance apart. This sequence tells the number of sets at each location on the line segment between A and B.",

This sequence gives the number of edge covers of the graph obtained from this K(3,n) graph after removing two edges, where the removed edges are not incident to the same vertex in A but are incident to the same vertex in B."
