        "It is sufficient to consider only prime bases: a(n+1) is the least composite number k such that p^(k-1) == 1 (mod k) for every prime p <= lpf(a(n)), with a(1) = 561.",
        "Conjecture: a(n+1) is the smallest Carmichael number k such that lpf(k) > lpf(a(n)), with a(1) = 561. It seems that such Carmichael numbers have exactly three prime factors.",
        "The above conjecture is true if A083876(n) < A285549(n) for all n > 1, but has not been proven; there is no a counterexample up to a(n) < 2^64. - _Max Alekseyev_ and _Thomas Ordowski_, Mar 13 2018",

        "Assuming a strong form of the prime k-tuples conjecture, if there are no small counterexamples, there are likely to be none.",
        "Here's why.",
        "Assuming prime k-tuples, there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers of the form (6k+1)(12k+1)(18k+1), where each factor is prime. And from Bateman-Horn, these are fairly thickly distributed. There are other even better triples such as (60k+41)(90k+61)(150k+101), where \"better\" means the least prime factor is not so far below the cube root.",
        "So, to get into the sequence, a number needs to be a Fermat pseudoprime for every base up to nearly the cube root.",
        "However, it's a theorem that a sufficiently large number with this property must be a Carmichael number. (End)",
