        "The triangle [a(23)=2535, 2329, 544] with gcd(2329, 544) = 17 is the first square Heron triangle for which the 3 sides [i, j, k] are not pairwise coprime, i.e., max(gcd(i,j), gcd(i,k), gcd(j,k)) > 1, but gcd(i,j,k) = 1. Are there more square Heron triangles with this property? - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Jul 18 2020",
        "There are other square Heron triangles with this property, e.g. [a(31)=3825, 2704, 1921] with gcd(1921, 3825) = 17; [a(??)=41460721, 38639097, 17536520] with gcd(38639097, 17536520) = 41; [a(??)=153915025, 139641489, 25224736] with gcd(25224736, 153915025) = 17; and [a(??)=4325561361, 3459908000, 1430190961] with gcd(3459908000, 1430190961) = 73. - _James R.
