    "comment": [
        "Minimality is relative to the ordering where x < y means the binary indices of x are a subset of those of y (a Boolean algebra).",
        "A binary index of n (row n of A048793) is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion.",
        "The axiom of choice says that, given any set of nonempty sets Y, it is possible to choose a set containing an element from each. The strict version requires this set to have the same cardinality as Y, meaning no element is chosen more than once."
