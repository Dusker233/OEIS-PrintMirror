        "Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions and the GRH suggest that average gaps between primes of the form 6k - 1 below x are about phi(6)*log(x). This sequence shows that the record gap ending at p grows almost as fast as phi(6)*log^2(p). Here phi(n) is A000010, Euler's totient function; phi(6)=2.",
