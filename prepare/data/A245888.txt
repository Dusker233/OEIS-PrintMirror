        "The number of labeled increasing unary-binary trees with an associated permutation avoiding 231 in the classical sense.  The tree's permutation is found by recording the labels in the order in which they appear in a breadth-first search.  (Note that a breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree labels left to right by levels, starting with the root.)",
        "In some cases, the same breadth-first search reading permutation can be found on differently shaped trees.  This sequence gives the number of trees, not the number of permutations."
