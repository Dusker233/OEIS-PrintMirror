A rooted tree is a semi-identity tree if the non-leaf branches of the root are all distinct and are themselves semi-identity trees. The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree is the product of primes indexed by the Matula-Goebel numbers of its branches (of the root), which gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled rooted trees."
