        "These are the achiral polyominoes of the regular tiling with Schl\u00e4fli symbol {3,6}. An achiral polyomino is identical to its reflection. This sequence can most readily be calculated by enumerating achiral fixed polyominoes for three situations with a given axis of symmetry: 1) fixed polyominoes with an axis of symmetry composed of cell edges, A364485; 2) fixed polyominoes with a vertical axis of symmetry composed of cell altitudes and a vertex as the highest polyomino point on this axis, A364486; and 3) fixed polyominoes with a vertical axis of symmetry composed of cell altitudes and an edge center as the highest polyomino point on this axis, A364487. Those three sequences include each achiral polyomino exactly twice. - _Robert A. Russell_, Jul 26 2023"
