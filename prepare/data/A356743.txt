        "If an even number has exactly 6 divisors, then it is of the form 32, 4*p or 2*p^2 for an odd prime p. Note that 4*p + 2 = 2*q^2 is impossible since q^2 - 1 is divisible by 24 for prime q >= 5. As a result, if k is an even term, then it is of the form 2*p^2 such that (p^2+1)/2 is a prime (p is in A048161)."
