        "Let b(i) give the i-th bit of a string indexed {0...j-1}, let s > 1 divide j, define (s-)seam as a decimation b(i == r (mod j/s)), and let n count carbon atoms. Then the stable deoxy-n-itol isomers of Nemba and Fah enumerate as bit strings of length 2n and Hamming weight h = n+1, up to reversal, with b(0) = b(2n-1) = 1, and such that a 2-seam colored 00 destabilizes a string. [Ex. 111100 fails because its last bit is 0 and 101101 fails because it decimates 1 (mod 3) to 00.]",
        "The seam 0 (mod n) may not be 01 and the seam n-1 (mod n) may not be 10; otherwise, 2-seams permute freely as compositions of n+1 into n parts using one kind of 2 (11) and two kinds of 1 (01 10). The number of stable strings follows by inex [exclude the two restrictions disjointly and include them jointly: A001787(n) - 2*A001787(n-1) + A001787(max(n-2, 0))]: combining terms gives A045623(n-1).",
        "Now if n is even, h is odd and no palindromes may be colored, while if n is odd, palindromy induces a monochromatic seam (n-1)/2 (mod n) which may only be colored 11. Stable strings invariant to reversal are thus palindromes of length 2n == 2 (mod 4) with min(n, 2) impermutable bit pairs [their endpoints must also be colored 11; the pairs coincide when n=1] so that, in this case, the inex of curated wreath products exemplified at Table I of NF95 reduces to (A045623(n-1) + A011782((n-1)/2)(n mod 2))/2.
