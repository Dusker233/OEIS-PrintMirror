        "A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets. The dual of a set-system has, for each vertex, one edge consisting of the indices (or positions) of the edges containing that vertex. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,3}} is {{1},{1,2},{2}}. An antichain is a set-system where no edge is a subset of any other. This sequence counts set-systems whose dual is a (strict) antichain, also called T_1 set-systems."
