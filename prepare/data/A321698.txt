        "A multiset multisystem is a finite multiset of finite multisets. A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. The multiset multisystem with MM-number n is formed by taking the multiset of prime indices of each part of the multiset of prime indices of n. For example, the prime indices of 78 are {1,2,6}, so the multiset multisystem with MM-number 78 is {{},{1},{1,2}}.",
        "A multiset multisystem is uniform if all parts have the same size, and regular if all vertices appear the same number of times. For example, {{1,1},{2,3},{2,3}} is uniform and regular, so its MM-number 15463 belongs to the sequence."
