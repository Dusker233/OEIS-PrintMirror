        "A stable partition of a graph is a set partition of the vertices where no edge has both ends in the same block. The chromatic symmetric function is given by X_G = Sum_p m(t(p)) where the sum is over all stable partitions of G, t(p) is the integer partition whose parts are the block-sizes of p, and m is augmented monomial symmetric functions (see A321895). A graph is e-positive if, in the expansion of its chromatic symmetric function in terms of elementary symmetric functions, all coefficients are nonnegative."
