        "Apart from the first term, all terms are primes (Mersenne exponents) or powers of two (Fermat exponents). The sequence consists of all members of A000043 and A092506, apart from 2. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 20 2010",

        "The sequence \"Numbers k such that 2^k + (-1)^k is a prime\" gives essentially the same sequence, except with the initial 1 replaced by 2. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Dec 26 2016",
        "The union of 2 and this sequence gives the values k for which 2^k or 2^k - 1 are the numbers in A006549. - _Gionata Neri_, Dec 19 2015",
        "The union of 2 and this sequence is the values k for which either 2^k - 1 or 2^k + 1, or both, are prime. The reason why this only yields one additional term, 2, is because the number 3 always divides either 2^k - 1 or 2^k + 1 (also implicit in Ordowski comment). - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Feb 19 2023"
