        "The points with coordinates (x,y) = (A348449(n), A348448(n)), n = 1,2,3,... are the upper envelope of the graph of A307730. Based on the first 10^6 terms of A307730 we get 110 points on the upper envelope, which appear to lie very roughly on the curve y = x^0.57. It would be nice to have a more trustworthy expression for this curve!"
