        "A binary carry of two positive integers is an overlap of the positions of 1's in their reversed binary expansion.",
        "The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k), so these are squarefree numbers whose prime indices have no carries. A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798."
