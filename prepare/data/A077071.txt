        "Given n balls, all of which are initially in the first of n numbered boxes, a(n-1) is the number of steps of the following process required to move them all to the last box. A step consists of first identifying j, the lowest numbered box which has at least one ball. If it has only one ball then move it to box j+1; otherwise move half its balls rounded down to box j+1 and (unless it's the first box) half its balls rounded down to box j-1.
