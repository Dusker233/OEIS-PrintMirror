    "comment": [
        "If k is prime then [k] is the only prime partition of k with least part k, and therefore k cannot be in this sequence. If k > 2 is even, then (assuming the validity of Goldbach's conjecture) there is a prime partition [p,q] of k (p <= q) in which p is the greatest possible least part and therefore no other partition of k is possible with least part p, so k is not a term. Therefore all terms of this sequence are odd composites."
    ],
    "example": [
        "9 is not a term because [3,3,3] is the only prime partition of 9 having 3 as least part.",
        "63 is a term because every possible prime partition is accounted for as follows, where (m,p) means m partitions of 63 with least part p: (2198,2), (323,3), (60,5), (15,7), (5,11), (2,13), (2,17), (sum of m values = 2605 = A000607(63)). 63 must be in the sequence because (1,p) does not appear in this list, and is the smallest such number because every odd composite < 63 has at least one prime partition with unique least part (as for 9 above)."
