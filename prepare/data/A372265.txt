        "Information-theoretic bound on the largest card deck with which one can perform an n-card trick, when the assistant chooses two cards to hide.",
        "The bound is based on the following argument: The assistant has n choose 2 ways to pick the hidden cards and (n-2)! ways to arrange the rest of the cards. The number of strategies can't be smaller than the number of potential guesses by the magician which is d - n + 2 choose 2, where d is the deck size."
