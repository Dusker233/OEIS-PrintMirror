    "comment": [
        "All binary self-dual codes must have even length.  This is due to the fact that all binary self-dual codes contain the \"all 1's codeword\".  If a binary self-dual code could have odd length, the dot product of the \"all 1's codeword\" with itself would be equal to 1. A dot product of 1 would imply it is not orthogonal to itself and so the code could not be self-dual."
