        "The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1, ..., y_k) is prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k).",
        "An integer partition is superperiodic if either it consists of a single part equal to 1 or its parts have a common divisor > 1 and its multiset of multiplicities is itself superperiodic. For example, (8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2) has multiplicities (4,4,2,2) with multiplicities (2,2) with multiplicities (2) with multiplicities (1). The first four of these partitions are periodic and the last is (1), so (8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2) is superperiodic."
