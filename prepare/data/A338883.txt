        "The Rubik's Cube group G is a subgroup of the symmetric group S_48 of order |G| = 43252003274489856000 = 2^27 * 3^14 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11, generated by the six face twists of the cube. The elements of G have 73 distinct orders. The exponent of G, given by the least common multiple of the orders of the elements, is 55440."
