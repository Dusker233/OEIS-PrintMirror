(Proof idea: Every acyclic edge set can be reduced to the empty set by removing one leaf edge at a time.) This can be interpreted as the number of ways of turning off storage nodes in an n X n array so that data remains restorable in the \"full scheme\" RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) design described by Nagel, S\u00fc\u00df.- _Jair Taylor_, Jul 29 2019"
