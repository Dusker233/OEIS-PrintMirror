    "comment": [
        "The square Manhattan lattice is an oriented square lattice in which the orientations are constant along horizontal and vertical lines, with pairs of consecutive lines having alternating orientations (similar to a generic portion of the streets and avenues of midtown Manhattan).",
        "In the hard-core (independent set) model on the ordinary two-dimensional integer lattice, the contours separating odd-occupied regions from even-occupied regions can be viewed as self-avoiding walks on the square Manhattan lattice that do take two consecutive turns. It follows via a standard Peierls argument that if a(n) grows like mu^n then the hard-core model on the ordinary two-dimensional integer lattice exhibits phase coexistence for all values of the fugacity above mu^4-1. See the Blanca, Chen, Galvin, Randall and Tetali reference for details.",
        "In the Blanca et al. reference these are called \"taxi walks\" because a savvy passenger in a Manhattan cab would be suspicious if the cab took two consecutive turns."
