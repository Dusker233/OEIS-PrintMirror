        "If k = Product p^e, then A162296(k) / A048250(k) = -1 + Product (p^(e+1) - 1)/(p^2 - 1). If k is exponentially odd, then e = 2*m - 1 is odd for all the prime factors p of k and p^(e+1) - 1 = (p^2)^m - 1 is divisible by p^2 - 1. Therefore, A162296(k) / A048250(k) is an integer for all exponentially odd numbers, and it is a positive integer for all the nonsquarefree (A013929) exponentially odd numbers.",
        "It seems that most of the terms of A301517 are exponentially odd numbers. For example, the first 10^4 terms of A301517 include only 9 terms that are not exponentially odd numbers. Up to 10^8 there are 9660732 terms of A301517, and only 9107 of them are not exponentially odd numbers.",
        "The number of terms of this sequence that are not exceeding 10^k, for k = 5, 6, ... are 9, 92, 916, 9107, 91172, 911187, .... Apparently, this sequence has an asymptotic density c = 0.000091... If this is true, then the asymptotic density of A301517 is c + A065463 - A059956 = 0.096606... (A065463 is the density of the exponentially odd numbers, and A059956 is the density of the squarefree numbers which are a subset of the exponentially odd numbers)."
