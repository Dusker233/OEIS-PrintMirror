        "It is known that there are infinitely many k such that k, k+1, k+2 are all sums of a positive square and a positive cube (see A055934 and A295787). It is natural to ask if this sequence is infinite. There are 243 members here below 10^9.",
        "There are 2 pairs of consecutive numbers below 10^9: (16597502, 16597503) and (593825496, 593825497). Are there infinitely many k such that k, k+1, k+2, k+3 and k+4 are all sums of a positive square and a positive cube?"
