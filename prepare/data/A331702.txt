        "Sequence counts intersections among all distinct circles such that: A circle is defined by a pair of distinct points of a regular n-sided polygon. First point is the center of the circle, while the distance between the points defines the radius of the circle.",
        "It seems one additional intersection exists at the center of the polygon if and only if n is a multiple of 6. From this and n symmetries of the n-sided regular polygon, it would follow that n divides either a(n) or a(n)-1, depending on whether n is a multiple of 6.",

These are all prime values except for the prime squares 4 and 25 which also appear. It is likely all primes appear although what other values lead to only simple vertices is unknown. (End)"
