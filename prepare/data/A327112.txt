    "comment": [
        "A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges. The cut-connectivity of a set-system is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed (along with any empty or duplicate edges) to obtain a disconnected or empty set-system. Except for cointersecting set-systems (A327040), this is the same as vertex-connectivity (A327334, A327051)."
