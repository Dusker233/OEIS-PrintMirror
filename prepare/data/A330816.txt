Heuristic evidence: I took the first few terms C and made the Cartesian product with C and the 101-smooth numbers <= 10^8, seeing which were terms and removing duplicates. This process was repeated a few times until no more new terms were found. The largest number of divisors of any of these terms is < 10^6. (End)"
