    "comment": [
        "A graph is k-semi-transitively orientable if it admits an acyclic orientation that avoids shortcuts of length k or less. The notion of a k-semi-transitive orientation refines that of a semi-transitive orientation, which is the case of k equal infinity. For n<9, the number of non-3-semi-transitively orientable graphs is precisely the number of non-semi-transitively orientable graphs, which in turn is the same as the number of non-word-representable graphs. For n=9, there are four 3-semi-transitively orientable graphs which are not semi-transitively orientable."
