        "A100003(n) = prime(a(n)). Next term is greater than 4500 and the prime corresponding to the next term has more than 21000 digits. Number of digits of primes corresponding to the six known terms of the sequence are respectively 1, 2, 9, 43, 198, and 4202. There is no known prime formed by concatenation of the first k odd primes in increasing order for 1 < k < 2250."
