        "For the modified congruence modulo n of Br\u00e4ndli and Beyne, called mod* n, see the link. See also the comments in A333856 for this reduced residue system mod* n, called RRS*(n), for n >= 1.",
        "The odd members of RRS*(n) are denoted by RRS*odd(n), similarly, RRS*even(n) are the even elements of RRS*(n). E.g., RRS*odd(5) = {1} and RRS*even(5) = {2}. Therefore the odd number 5 can be called balanced in the reduced mod* system, because #RRS*odd(5) = 1 = #RRS*even(5).",
        "All even numbers are unbalanced because RRS*(2*m) has only odd members, for m >= 1.",
        "b = 1, with RRS*(1) = {0} is unbalanced, and for odd numbers b >= 3 to be balanced one needs integer phi(b)/4 because #RRS*(b) = phi(b)/2 (phi = A000010). The odd integers >= 3 with integer phi(b)/4 are given in A327922. The present sequence gives, for n >= 2, a proper subset of A327922 consisting of odd numbers b with an unequal number of odd and even elements (unbalanced odd b). Therefore, the condition phi(b)/4 integer for odd b is necessary but not sufficient for such odd b in the reduced mod* system."
