        "Each term is the beginning of a run of three 2-almost primes (semiprimes). No runs exist of length greater than three. For the same reason, each term must be odd: If k were even, then so would be k+2. In fact, one of k or k+2 would be divisible by 4, so must indeed be 4 to have only two prime factors. However, neither 2,3,4 nor 4,5,6 is such a run. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, May 27 2002",
