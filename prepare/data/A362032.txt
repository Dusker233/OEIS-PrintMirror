    "comment": [
        "Dombi's conjecture, now refuted, stated that there is no infinite set A such that the power series (sum(X^a, a>=0 not in A))^3 has strictly increasing coefficients. This sequence is conjecturally the lexicographically least such example---\"conjecturally\" because it is obtained by backtracking and there is currently no proof it can be extended to infinity."
