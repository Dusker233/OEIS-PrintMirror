        "59 is the second irregular prime. The corresponding entry for the first irregular prime 37 is A251782, and for the third irregular prime 67 is A299467.",
        "The p-adic digits of the unique simple zero of the p-adic zeta function zeta_{(p,l)} with (p,l)=(59,44) were used to compute the sequence (see the Mathematica program below). This corresponds with Table A.2 in Kellner (2007). The sequence is increasing, but some consecutive entries are identical, e.g., entries 30 / 31 and 94 / 95. This is caused only by those p-adic digits that are zero."
