        "By Wolstenholme's Theorem, if p prime >= 5, the numerator of the harmonic number H_{p-1} is always divisible by p^2. The obtained quotients are in A061002. - _Bernard Schott_, Dec 02 2018",
        "The numbers 363, numerator of H_7 and 9227046511387, numerator of H_{29}, which have been found by Amiram Eldar and Michel Marcus, are also divisible by prime squares, respectively by 11^2 and 43^2, but not in the case of Wolstenholme's Theorem. So, a new sequence A322434 is created with all the numerators of Harmonic numbers which are divisible by any prime square >= 5. - _Bernard Schott_, Dec 08 2018"
