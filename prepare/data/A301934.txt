        "A positive subset-sum tree with root x is either the symbol x itself, or is obtained by first choosing a positive subset-sum x <= (y_1,...,y_k) with k > 1 and then choosing a positive subset-sum tree with root y_i for each i = 1...k. The weight is the sum of the leaves. We write positive subset-sum trees in the form rootsum(branch,...,branch). For example, 4(1(1,3),2,2(1,1)) is a positive subset-sum tree with composite 4(1,1,1,2,3) and weight 8."
