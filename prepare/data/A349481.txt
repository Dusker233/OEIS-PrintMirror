    "comment": [
        "Contranominal scales can be considered as Boolean matrices of size n X n full of ones except the main diagonal, which is filled by zeros (Ganter and R. Wille, 1999). The optimal number k of Boolean factors for a Boolean matrix A is known as its Schein rank (Kim, 1982; Marenich, 2010) and is defined as the smallest k such that A=P*Q, where * is Boolean matrix multiplication, A has the size n X m, and P,Q are n X k and k X m Boolean matrices, respectively. The problem of Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) is NP-hard and one of the state-of-the-art greedy algorithms is GreConD (Belohlavek & Vychodil, 2010). Contranominal scales are known as the worst theoretical case w.r.t. the number of potential Boolean factors (formal concepts), 2^n (Albano, 2014; Albano and Chornomaz, 2017; D\u00fcrrschnabel et al., 2021), while their Schein rank is given by A305233. The output of GreConD does not always result in the optimal number of factors for contranominal scales, so the sequence of its outputs is checked empirically for n up to 128 and the formula for a(n) is provided in (Ignatov & Yakovleva, 2021). See the links below for more checked examples up to n=513."
