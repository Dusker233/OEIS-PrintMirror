        "Note that a(n) is an n-almost-prime. An n-almost-prime is a number having exactly n prime factors (counted with multiplicity). So 1 is the only 0-almost-prime; 1-almost-primes are the usual prime numbers; 2-almost-primes are also called semiprimes. The first three terms are mentioned in A125149.",
