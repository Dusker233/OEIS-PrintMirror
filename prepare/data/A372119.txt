    "comment": [
        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.",
        "A finite multiset of numbers is defined to be biquanimous iff it can be partitioned into two multisets with equal sums. Biquanimous partitions are counted by A002219 and ranked by A357976."
