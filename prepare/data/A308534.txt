        "Between 10^k and 10^(k+1) there are (241, 3002, 27238, 183258, 1053624, 92482) terms, for k = 2..7. Any term must have at least two digits larger than 1, and must not have more than one digit 0. The smallest term with a digit 0 is 409, the largest one is 12250988. The number of terms in [10^k,10^(k+1)] with a digit 9 is (111, 1571, 16856, 153986, 1053624, 92482) (increasing from 50% to 100% for > 6 digits, for an overall 97% of terms having a digit 9), and with a digit 0: (15, 525, 6133, 51911, 344730, 53837) (increasing from 6% to about 50%), again for k = 2..7. - _M.

        "A proof that this sequence is finite.",
        "Suppose there exists a term m >= 10^9, so with d >= 9 digits, that belongs to this sequence. With these d digits of m, it is possible to get binomial(d,2) = d*(d-1)/2 >= 9*8/2 = 36 sums of integers with two digits of m. Now, the only possible sums obtained with two digits of m go from 0+1=1 to 9+9=18 and the LCM of {1, 2, ..., 18} = A003418(18) = 12252240. Therefore, the LCM of all possible sums of two digits for each number m is <= 12252240, and here m >= 10^9. We have these successive inequalities: LCM of all possible sums of two digits for number m <= 12252240 < 10^9 <= m; but, with the name, the LCM of all possible sums of two digits of m must be > m. There is a contradiction, there is no term m >= 10^9 in the sequence and thus this sequence is finite.",
