        "This can be phrased as the number of n X n X n permutation arrays which percolate with respect to the 3-neighbor bootstrap percolation rule in the n X n X n grid. C.f. Balogh, Bollob\u00e1s and Morris (2009).",
        "The analogous sequence for n X n permutation arrays with respect to 2-neighbor bootstrap percolation is enumerated by the Large Schr\u00f6der numbers A006318. See Shapiro and Stephens (1991)."

    "example": [
        "One example of such an array is the n X n X n array in which the (i,j,k) entry is 1 if i+j+k is 0 mod n. For n=2 and n=3, the arrays counted by a(n) are precisely the (n-1)!n! arrays that are obtained from this example by permuting rows and columns. For larger n, more complicated examples exist."
