        "A beta-stable nuclide is a nuclide whose beta decay (beta-minus and beta-plus decay) is energetically disallowed; that is to say, a nuclide that has lower energy then its isobars with one more or one less proton. Note that double beta decay is allowed. A nuclide whose beta decay is energetially allowed, even if not observed (in the case of 48Ca, 96Zr, 123Te, 148Gd, 180mTa, 222Rn and 247Cm), is not classified as being beta-stable.",
        "For n <= 101 not being a term in this sequence, there is only one odd-mass beta-stable isotope for element n, except that there is none for n = 18, 43, 58 and 61.",
        "2 is a term because even if 5He has extremely short half-life, it is beta-stable. 48, 49 and 52 are not terms because 113Cd, 115In and 123Te are not beta-stable as primordial nuclides.",
        "Different models predict different continuations for this sequence: Page 12 of the Zagrebaev et al. link predicts 101, (3 numbers in 105 ~ 108, assuming Lr and Mt each have a beta-stable isotopes and Sg, Bh and Hs each have at most two beta-stable isotopes of odd mass number), 110, 112, 114 (page 12). A Russian source predicts 102, 104, 105 or 106, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118. Pages 14-15 of the Hiroyuki Koura link predict 101, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 113, 116, 117, 118, 120, 122, 124 (pages 14-15)."
