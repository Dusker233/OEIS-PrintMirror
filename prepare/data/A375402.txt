        "First differs from A349810 in lacking 150.",
        "An anti-run is a sequence with no adjacent equal terms. The maxima of maximal anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal anti-run subsequences and taking the greatest term of each.",

        "The maximal anti-runs of prime factors of 150 are ((2,3,5),(5)), with maxima (5,5), so 150 is not in the sequence.",
