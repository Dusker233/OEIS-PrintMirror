        "The Jacobi of modular reductions of a number is often used by a bignum library to give a quick (negative) answer to the question of whether an integer is an exact square. This sequence gives the cutoffs for ever-increasing numbers of required modular tests, on the assumption that one is avoiding a brute force square-root/square/compare. All terms to 8794864 found by Jack Brennen."
