        "Up to 10^15, the largest prime divisor of a term is 178987 for which the product of the primes with multiplicity 1 of sigma(178987^2) is 16653 = 3 * 7 * 13 * 61. The second largest prime divisor is 25073 (for which sigma(25073^2) has a product of primes with multiplicity 1 of 341 = 11 * 31), which is quite a bit smaller than 178987. Can we somehow constrain the list of possible prime divisors to ease computation? (End)"
