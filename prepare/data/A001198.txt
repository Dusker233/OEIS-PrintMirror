        "Guy denotes k_{a,b}(m,n) the least k such that any m X n matrix with k '1's and '0's elsewhere has an a X b submatrix with all '1's, and omits b (resp. n) when b = a (resp. n = m). With this notation, a(n) = k_3(n). Sierpi\u0144ski (1951) found a(4..6), a(7) is due to Brzezi\u0144ski and a(8) due to \u010cul\u00edk (1956). - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 28 2021"
