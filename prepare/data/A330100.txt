        "A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets of positive integers.",
        "We define the VDD (vertex-degrees decreasing) normalization of a set-system to be obtained by first normalizing so that the vertices cover an initial interval of positive integers, then applying all permutations to the vertex set, then selecting only the representatives whose vertex-degrees are weakly decreasing, and finally taking the least of these representatives, where the ordering of sets is first by length and then lexicographically.",
        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system (finite set of finite nonempty sets of positive integers) has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.",
