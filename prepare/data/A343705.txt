        "This sequence differs from A343704 at term 20 because 1252 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 5^3 + 5^3 + 10^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 6^3 + 10^3 = 3^3 + 3^3 + 7^3 + 7^3 + 8^3 = 3^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 6^3 + 9^3. Thus this term is in A343704 but not in this sequence.",
        "Comment from _D. S. McNeil_, May 13 2021: (Start)",
        "If we weaken positive cubes to nonnegative cubes, Deshouillers, Hennecart, and Landreau (2000) give numerical and heuristic evidence that all numbers past 7373170279850 are representable as the sum of 4 nonnegative cubes.",
        "So if they are right, then eventually we can just take some N and represent each of (N-1^3, N-2^3, N-3^3, N-4^3) as the sum of four cubes and then take 1^3, 2^3, 3^3, or 4^3 as our fifth cube, giving at least four 5-cube representations for N.",
        "So it is very likely that the set of numbers representable by the sum of 5 positive cubes in exactly three ways is finite. (End)",
        "It is conjectured that the number of ways of writing N as a sum of 5 positive cubes grows like C(N)*N^(2/3), where C(N) depends on N but is bounded away from zero by an absolute constant (Vaughan, 1981; Vaughan and Wooley, 2002). So the number will exceed 3 as soon as N is large enough, and so it is very likely that this sequence is finite. However, at present this is an open question. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 15 2021 (based on correspondence with Robert Vaughan and Trevor Wooley)."
