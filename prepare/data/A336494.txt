    "name": "The number of steps for a walk on a square spiral numbered board when starting on square 1 and stepping to an unvisited square containing the lowest prime number, where the square is within a block of size (2n+1) X (2n+1) centered on the current square. If no unvisited prime numbered squares exist within the block the walk ends.",

        "For n = 1 this sequence is similar to A335856 except that only prime numbers can be stepped to; if no adjacent prime number exists then the walk ends. In general for a(n) the walk can step to any unvisited square containing the lowest prime number within a block of size (2n+1) X (2n+1) centered on the current square.",

For this and other images a green square shows the starting 1 square, a red square shows the final square, and a thick white line is the path between visited squares. All visited prime numbered squares are shown in yellow, while those unvisited squares containing primes are shown in grey. Blue squares mark out the (2n+1)x(2n+1) block of squares around the final square which contains no further unvisited primes. The square spiral numbering of the board is shown as a thin white line.",
