        "Original name: In the '3x + 1' problem we would expect a positive integer n to be approximately equal to 2^j / 3^k where j is the number of halving steps and k is the number of '3x + 1' steps required to reach 1. The numbers in this sequence are those for which 2^j / (n*3^k) sets a new record.",
        "Eric Roosendaal calls 2^j / (n*3^k) the residue of n and conjectures that 993 yields the highest residue. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 08 2007",
        "It has been verified that the next value, if it exists, is larger than 2^32 ~ 4.3e9. We do not need an \"escape clause\" (as for A006577, A006666, A006667, ...) in this sequence since the unlikely case of a possibly undefined ratio is irrelevant for the list of records. - _M. F.
