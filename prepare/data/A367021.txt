        "It seems that more than one consecutive number set from one kind or the other may exist for a term. Also, for some terms, an equal number of addends from each kind may correspond."

        "5 is a term because 5 = 1 + 4 = 2 + 3, which is the sum of two consecutive nonprimes and also the sum of two consecutive primes.",
