        "Zelinsky (2002) called these numbers p-generators. He proved that these are the tau numbers k such that for any prime p, if p does not divide k then p*k is also a tau number. He used these numbers to prove that the number of tau numbers not exceeding m is > pi(m)/2 for all m > 7.42*10^13, where pi(m) = A000720(m)."
