        "The terms are from numeric computation - no formula for a(n) is currently known.",

        "If instead one takes points on the x and y axes with coordinates 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ..., 1/n, 0, and joins them all by line segments, the resulting figure contains only triangles and quadrilaterals, and the number of regions is given by A332358 (and more generally by A332357 if there are m+1 such points on the x axis and n+1 such points on the y axis)."
