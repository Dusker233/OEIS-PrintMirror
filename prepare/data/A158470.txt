        "If the condition holds, prime(k-1) and prime(k) are twin primes. These are of the form 10m+9 and 10m+1. I.e., the last digits are 9 and 1. This is true because a square number must end in 0,1,4,5,6,9. So prime(k-1)+7 is square => it must end in one of these numbers. So to find the ending of prime(k-1), we subtract 7 from 0,1,4,5,6,9 to get the last digit, i.e., 3,4,7,8,9,2.",
        "Since prime(k-1) is prime, endings 2,4,5,8 are not allowed. This leaves us with 3,7,9 as possible endings of prime(k-1). Now to get prime(k), which the condition states is 2 greater than prime(k-1), we add 2 and 3+2=5 => prime(k) not prime, impossible. So the possible endings of prime(k-1) are reduced to 7 or 9. Now the condition prime(k-1)+7 = prime(k+1)-1 => prime(k-1)+8 = prime(k+1). Then adding 7 => prime(k+1) ends in 5, impossible. So prime(k-1) must end in 9, and adding 2 makes prime(k) end in 1. This sequence is a calculation of the conjecture provided in the link. The PARI script provides for the general investigation of numbers of the form prime(k-1)+a and prime(k+1)-b. The values a=5,7; b=1 consistently yield twin primes when the condition holds.",
        "Notice we test for square of the first prime(k-1) retrieval before calling the second prime(k+1). This cuts the search time in half. A far superior search routine is the C program found in the link, which reads a huge 300 GB file of the primes < 1 trillion + 1 billion."
