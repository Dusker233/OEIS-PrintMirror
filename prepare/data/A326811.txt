        "A326806 = A326811 UNION A326833 UNION A090019 UNION A093143. Note that several terms (e.g. a(10), a(13), a(17)-a(19)) look like the rounding off of a periodic sequence, i.e. yxxxa9xxxa9xxxa9... rounded off to yxxxa9xxxa9xxxb, where b = a+1. Perhaps these can be considered near-cyclic numbers? - _Chai Wah Wu_, Oct 21 2019"
