        "These numbers were generated as part of a proof of the dimensionality of the larger space of disconnected chord diagrams modulo 4T, and the code/combinatorics are provided in the paper.",
        "At the time, computation was an issue but now it's likely the methods could be used to generate more terms. No generating function is known."
