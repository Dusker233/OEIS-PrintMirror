    "comment": [
        "A graceful graph with e edges is one that allows a labeling of its vertices with distinct integers between 0 and e, inclusive, such that when each edge is labeled with the absolute difference of the labels of its endpoints, these edge labels will be exactly the integers between 1 and e, inclusive.",
        "This sequence counts the minimal number edges possible, in a regular graceful graph of valence n.",
        "The concept was introduced by Ed Pegg in a post on Mathematics Stack Exchange; all the data here is from that post.",
        "Pegg conjectures that the sequence continues (from n = 13): 130, 147, 180, 192, 221, 243, 285, 320, 336."
