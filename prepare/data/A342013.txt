        "The binary length of these numbers (A070939, = 1+A000523) grows by 0 or 1 at each step, thus the next colossally abundant number is always found on either on the same row (right of the current CA-number), or the next row of A329886, the row immediately below. The next CA-number will be on the same row only when its factorization contains neither a new prime nor yet another instance of prime 2."
