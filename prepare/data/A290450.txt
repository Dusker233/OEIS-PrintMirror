        "Starts off the same as A031928, primes p such that the next prime is p + 10. First term that differs is 887, since 897 = 3 * 13 * 23 and the next prime is 907.",
        "As the primes get larger and more sparsely distributed, the difference between successive primes is less likely to be less than 10.",
        "One might expect that a prime is 1/4 as likely to be followed by a prime with the same least significant digit in base 10 (since the possibilities are 1, 3, 7, 9).",
        "One might also expect this sequence to consist of a quarter of the primes. And yet pi(a(50)) = pi(3547) = 497; the 200th prime is 1223."
