        "It has been shown by Dick Hess and Benji Fisher that a number k >= 20 is in the sequence iff k == 0 or 1 (mod 4). (For a proof see the Applegate link.) It is easy to see that k == 0 or 1 (mod 4) is a necessary condition.",

        "An obvious greedy algorithm (working backwards) does the following: For j = k, k-1, ..., 1, let target_j = k - Sum_{i = j+1..k} i * s_i and set s_j = +1 if target_j >= j and s_j = -1 otherwise. This works unless we hit one of five exceptions, in which we must set s_j = -1 instead of +1.",
        "The five exceptions are when (j, target_j) is (5,5), (6,9), (7,14), (8,8), or (9,13). The algorithm also works for the more general case when the target total target_k is different from k, with the additional exception of (8,20). (End)"
