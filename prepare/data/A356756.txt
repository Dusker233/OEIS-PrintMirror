    "comment": [
        "This sequence is related to A188424, since we are considering only the addends m := 2n - 1 of k^2 + k + 2n - 1 such that A188424(n)/(2n - 1) > 1/2.",
        "It is not a subsequence of A356751, nor vice versa, since 1 is a peculiar term, whereas 3 and 7 do not belong to the present sequence, even if they are terms of A356751.",
        "Furthermore, it is conjectured that the present sequence consists of only 15 terms (it has been checked by brute force that there are only 15 terms which are smaller than 20000). Lastly, we trivially point out that all terms must be odd, since if m is even, then x^2 + x + m is also even.",
        "We trivially note that all the terms are odd (since x^2 + x + 2 is not prime for x = 1, nor for x = 2) and a(n - 1) = A356751(n) holds for every n > 3.",
        "For an explanation of the abundance of primes of the form x^2 + x + m, for some given m, see Goudsmit's paper in Links."
