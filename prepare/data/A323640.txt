        "3) Numbers of the form 2^2 * p * q where p and q = p+4 are primes and p > 3. These primes p are in A023200 \\ {3} and the pair (x,y) = (4,p). The first few terms are 308, 884, ...",
        "4) More generally, numbers of the form 2^k * p * q where p and q = p+2^k are primes and the pair (x,y) = (2^k,p). For k = 3, the smallest such term is 1672 with p = 11. (End)"
