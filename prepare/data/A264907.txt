        "Are the prime factors of a(n) always a \"normal sequence of primes\" in the sense of A100564? Equivalently, can you always find a(n) by starting from a suitable smallest prime p_1, and then pick the subsequent prime factors greedily (under the condition that p_j - 1 is not divisible by any p_i) until you have n primes? If yes, then it is easy to calculate a(n), as all one needs to do is find the optimal starting prime. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, May 23 2021"
