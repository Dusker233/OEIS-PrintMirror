        "The total number of appearances of a number n in A307730 is required to be n. For the numbers listed here, those appearances are spread out over more than n terms of A307730.",
        "These are the numbers n for which A348250(n) is nonzero.",
        "It would be nice to have an independent characterization of these numbers. It is a theorem that no primes can appear, but what more can be said? The graph is roughly linear, and the first differences are small but irregular."
