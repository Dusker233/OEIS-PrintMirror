        "All terms except 1 are divisible by 3.  Proof: suppose n>1 is in the sequence, and let p be its smallest prime factor.  Of course p is odd.  Since 4^n-1 is divisible by p, n is divisible by the multiplicative order of 4 mod p, which is less than p.  But since n has no prime factors < p, that multiplicative order can only be 1, which means p=3. - _Robert Israel_, Jan 24 2019"
