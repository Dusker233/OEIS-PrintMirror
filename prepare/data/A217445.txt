        "The number of zeros of n! base 3 is approaching n/2 as n grows. Similarly, the number of zeros of n! base 4 is approaching n/2 as n grows. Consequently, this sequence is expected to have high density.",

        "Since typically A000120(n) ~ log_2(n) while typically A053735(n) ~ log_3(n), the density of this sequence should go to 0, contrary to the previous comment. (End)",
