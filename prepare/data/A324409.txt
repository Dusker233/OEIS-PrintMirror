    "comment": [
        "Redelmeier uses these rings to enumerate polyominoes of the regular tiling {4,4} with fourfold rotational symmetry (A144553) and an even number of cells. Each cell of a polyomino ring is adjacent to (shares an edge with) exactly two other cells. Each achiral ring is identical to its reflection and has eightfold symmetry.",
        "For n odd, the center of the ring is a vertex of the tiling; for n even, the center is the center of a tile.",
        "For k > 0, the numbers of achiral rings with 8k and 8k+4 cells are the same. In the former, there are four cells in the same row or column as the center tile; we obtain the latter by moving all the cells one-half a tile away from the center in both the horizontal and vertical directions, replacing those four center-line cells with four pairs of cells."
