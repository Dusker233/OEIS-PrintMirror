I.e., every free polyomino is counted twice here unless it is symmetric with respect to a Pi/2 rotation centered at a cell, or a Pi rotation centered at an edge, or a reflection with respect to an axis parallel to the grid and passing through cells."

    "example": [
        "There are 2 ways to color the 4 corners of a monomino with black and white colors alternatingly, but they are related by a rotation or a reflection, so a(1) = 1. a(2) is also 1 because the two ways to color the 6 vertices of a domino with black and white colors in the checkerboard pattern are related to each other by a reflection or a rotation. The same is true for the stick tromino, but the two ways to color the 8 vertices of the L-tromino are inequivalent, so a(3) = 3."
