        "There are roughly 5/(18n log 10) * 10^n members of this sequence up to 10^n: all primes between 10^k and 2*10^k, half the primes between 3*10^k and 4*10^k, 3/5 of the primes between 7*10^k and 8*10^k, and 1/4 of the primes between 9*10^k and 10*10^k for all 1 < k < n, using the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions. Thus the 'probability' that a random number up to 10^n is in this sequence is 0.12/n."
