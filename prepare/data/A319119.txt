        "A multimin factorization of n is an ordered factorization of n into factors greater than 1 such that the sequence of minimal primes dividing each factor is weakly increasing. A multimin tree-factorization of n is either the number n itself or a sequence of multimin tree-factorizations, one of each factor in a multimin factorization of n with at least two factors.",
