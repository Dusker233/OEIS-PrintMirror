        "A piece is a 2 X 2 matrix of distinct numbers, each called a label. A standard piece is a 2 X 2 matrix containing, in some order, the numbers {1,2,3,4} once each. A piece p_1 can be reduced to a standard piece p_2 if p_2 preserves the label order of p_1. For example,",

        "A standard puzzle of the shape 2 X k is a 2 X k matrix containing, in some order, {1,2,...,2k}. A support P for a standard puzzle Q of the shape 2 X k is a finite set of standard pieces {p_1,p_2,...} such that for any 2 X 2 submatrix T of Q, there exists a p_x in P such that T is equivalent to p_x under reduction.",
        "A support P is connected if for any two pieces p_1, p_2 in P, there exists a standard puzzle containing p_1 and p_2 in its support. Two supports P, P' are equivalent under support-reduction if P' can be reached from P by: 1) exchanging the left and right columns of every piece in P, 2) exchanging the top and bottom row of every piece in P, and/or 3) replacing each label c of every piece in P with (5-c).",
        "Note: Han (see Links) simply calls support-reduction \"reduction.\" It has been called \"support-reduction\" here to distinguish it from the reduction of pieces into standard pieces.",
