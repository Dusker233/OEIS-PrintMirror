        "For 3 <= n <= 11, a(n) = binomial(n,3) = A000292(n-2) and the complete graph is the unique extremal graph, but a(12) = 225 > binomial(12,3), where the unique extremal graph is K_{6,6}.",
        "Morrison and Scott (2017) prove that, for sufficiently large n (they say it ought to be true for n >= 30), a(n) = A276401(n), with the unique extremal graph being the empty cyclic braid graph with one cluster of size 4 if n == 1 (mod 3), one cluster of size 2 if n == 2 (mod 3), and all other clusters of size 3. (The empty cyclic braid graph is obtained by arranging clusters of nodes of the appropriate sizes in a cycle and joining all pairs of nodes in neighboring clusters with edges.) For 14 <= n <= 21, this graph is not extremal, because the balanced bipartite graph K_{floor(n/2),ceiling(n/2)} has A028723(n+1) > A276401(n) induced cycles."
