        "Starting from the term 6, the next term can be obtained from the previous one by appending its \"horizontally\" flipped variant (6 <-> 9, which equals its binary complement). Also, starting from the term 69, every second term stays same if read upside down from the other end (i.e., those numbers look same even if you rotate them by 180 degrees)."
