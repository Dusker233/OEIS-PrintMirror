    "comment": [
        "Full graphs are defined as follows: A tree T with n vertices is bipartite, let its parts be of size k and n - k with k <= n-k, we rename T as T_k and we say it has type (k, n - k).  If a graph G has a spanning tree T_k of type (k,n-k) for each k such that 1 <= k <= [n/2], then we say that G is full.",
        "Full graphs will be featured in an upcoming article by Jayasooriya, McSorley, and Schuerger."

        "a(4)=3 as follows. Of the eleven nonisomorphic graphs on four vertices, only four of them contain a subgraph isomorphic to K_{1,3}, and thus a spanning tree of type (1,3).  One of these four graphs does not contain a spanning tree of type (2,2), while the other three graphs each contain a Hamiltonian path and thus a spanning tree of type (2,2)."
