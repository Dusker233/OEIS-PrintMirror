        "This sequence differs from A030299 starting from a(409114) = 10123456789. All the permutations are listed once and only once (e.g., the concatenation of the permutations of the elements of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} originates the number 1112345678910 which is a unique element of this sequence and appears only once, since 1_11_23456789 = 11_1_23456789 = 1112345678910).",
        "A001292 is a subsequence of the present sequence. An open problem, published by Kenichiro Kashihara in 1996 (see References, p. 25, #30, Problem 2), is to find how many terms of A001292 (which is a subsequence of A030299) are powers of integers; Kashihara conjectured that there are none (even if, clearly, A001292(1) = 1 should be disregarded in order to keep the conjecture alive). Currently, only the terms up to the prime a(409120) = 10123457689 have been directly checked by the author of this sequence and no nontrivial perfect power has been found. On the other hand, many (maybe infinitely many) terms of the present sequence are nontrivial powers of integers (e.g., A352329(2) to A352329(36) are squares of integers and belong to this sequence).",
        "Although A181129 is a subsequence of the present one, so that A181129(1) = a(19) = 2341, a(14) is the smallest prime in this sequence.",
