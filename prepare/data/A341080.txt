The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 5 has a solution is 31, but the smallest x in this case is 6, which is less than 11. The next prime, D, after 31 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 5 has a solution is 41 and the least x for which it has a solution is 13, which is larger than 11, so it is a new record value. 29 is a term of A341079 and 11 is a term of this sequence, but 31 is not a term of A341079 because the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 5 has a solution is not a record value.",
