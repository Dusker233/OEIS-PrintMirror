    "comment": [
        "In a linear chord diagram a \"bubble\" is defined as a set of consecutive vertices such that no two adjacent vertices are joined by a chord, i.e., \"short\" chords are not allowed. A bubble is therefore bounded externally either by short chords, or by the ends of the diagram. In a crystallized diagram, all chords are either short, or \"bridge\" two distinct bubbles, i.e., they have one vertex in one bubble, and the other vertex in a separate bubble. a(n) is the total number of such diagrams built from n chords."
    ],
    "example": [
        "For n = 3, let the vertices of the linear chord diagram be A,B,C,D,E,F. There are two diagrams with a single short chord: (AF)(BE)(CD) and (AE)(BF)(CD). There are three diagrams with two short chords: (AB)(CF)(DE), (AD)(BC)(EF), and (AF)(BC)(DE). Finally, there is one diagram with all three chords short: (AB)(CD)(EF). In total, there is therefore a(3) = 6 crystallized diagrams."
