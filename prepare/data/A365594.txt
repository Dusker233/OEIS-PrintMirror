        "The Whittaker's Root Series Formula is applied to 1+x-x^2/2+x^3/3-x^4/4+x^5/5-x^6/6 +..., which is 1 + the Taylor expansion of log(1+x). The series obtained after applying Whittaker's Root Series Formula: 1/e-1=(-1)/1+(1/2)/(1*3/2)+(1/12)/((3/2)*(7/3))+(1/18)/((7/3)*(11/3))+(1/20)/((11/3)*(347/60))+(563/10800)/((347/60)*(3289/360))+ ... . The series can be simplified to: 1/e=1/3+1/42+1/154+9/3817+1126/1141283+ ... . The sequence is formed by the denominators of the simplified series.",
        "The fractions in the denominators of the non-simplified series seem to be equal to terms from A323339 divided by the corresponding terms from A323340. Thus, the Whittaker's Root Series for 1 + the Taylor expansion of log(1+x) offers an alternative method for obtaining the terms of A323339 and A323340 using the determinants of Toeplitz matrices (formed using the coefficients of 1 + the Taylor expansion of log(1+x))."
