        "A semi-circular polygon with n+2 points is created by placing n+2 equally spaced vertices along a semicircle's arc, which includes the two end vertices. Now connect every pair of vertices by a straight line segment. The sequence gives the number of regions in the resulting figure.",
        "Note that there is a curious relationship between the terms of this sequence and the number of regions in the 'general position' polygon given in A006522. They are a match except for every third term starting at a(8) = 234. Examining the images for n = 8,11,14,17 shows that these polygons have interior points at which three or more lines intersect, while the other n values have no such intersection points. Such multi-line intersection points will reduce the number of regions as compared to the general position polygon which has no multi-line intersection points. This is reflected by the terms in this sequence being lower than the corresponding value in A006522 for n = 8,11,14,... . Why every third value of n in this sequence starting at n = 8 leads to polygons having multiple line intersection points while other values of n do not is currently not known."
