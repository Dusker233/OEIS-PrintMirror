        "a(n) is the largest number of coins obtainable by making repeated moves in this puzzle: Start with empty boxes B(i), i=1..n, and place one coin in B(1). One can iterate moves of two types: (1) remove a coin from a nonempty B(i) (i <= n-1) and place two coins in B(i+1); (2) remove a coin from a nonempty B(i) (i <= n-2) and switch the contents of B(i+1) and B(i+2).",
