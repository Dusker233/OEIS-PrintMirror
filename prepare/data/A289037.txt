        "Let N1(n) be the number of 1's in the n-th iterate theta(n) of the final-letter-removed mapping defined in A289035. It was observed in A293077 that  N1(n) = L(n-1)/2, where L(n) = A293077(n) is the length of the n-th iterate theta(n) of the final-letter-removed mapping. As usual, proving a(n)/n -> 2 + sqrt(2) is the same as proving that the frequency of 1's in A293077 is equal to 1/(2 + sqrt(2)) = 1 - sqrt(2)/2 =: mu. Ignoring a proof of the existence of the limit, this means that we have to show that",
