        "The adjusted frequency depth of an integer partition is 0 if the partition is empty, and otherwise it is one plus the number of times one must take the multiset of multiplicities to reach a singleton. For example, the partition (32211) has adjusted frequency depth 5 because we have: (32211) -> (221) -> (21) -> (11) -> (2).",
        "The term \"frequency depth\" appears to have been coined by Clark Kimberling in A225485 and A225486, and can be applied to both integers (A323014) and integer partitions (A325280).",
        "Run lengths are A325258, i.e., first differences of Levine's sequence A011784 (except at n = 1)."
