        "The multigraph cube of an n-cycle has n nodes V1, V2, ... Vn, with one edge Vi to Vj for each pair (i,j) such that j = i+1, i+2 or i+3 modulo n. It is a multigraph when n <= 6 because this produces instances of multiple edges between the same two vertices, and it also produces loops if n <= 3.",

The complete graph on 4 vertices has 4^2 = 16 spanning trees, and each of those spanning trees corresponds to 8 spanning trees of the multigraph tree because there are independent choices of 2 multigraph edges to be made for each of the three edges in the graph's spanning tree. So a(4) = 16 * 8 = 128."
