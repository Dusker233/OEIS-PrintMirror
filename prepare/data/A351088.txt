        "Sequence includes also the terms for which no iterations are needed (when k is already equal to A327860(k)), thus A328110 is a subsequence. The other terms (and also 1) seem to be the intersection of primorials (A002110) with sequence A099308.",
        "The numbers k for which A276086(k) is reachable from k by iterating A003415 form a subsequence of this sequence, but so far only one term is known: 6, for which A276086(6) = A003415(6) = 5. (See A351228). It would be interesting to know whether there are more such terms, especially terms that require more than one iteration of A003415."
