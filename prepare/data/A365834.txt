        "k, m, k + m and m - k all have n prime divisors iff 2*k, 2*m, 2*k + 2*m and 2*m - 2*k all have n+1 prime divisor. 2*m is the next number after 2*k with n+1 prime divisors iff m is the next number after k with n prime divisors and between 2*k and 2*m there are no odd numbers with n+1 prime divisors.  But the smallest odd number with n+1 prime divisors is 3^(n+1), and 3^(n+1) > 2^(n-1) * 3 * 113 for n >= 10. To complete the proof, we verify computationally the claim for n = 8, 9 and 10."
