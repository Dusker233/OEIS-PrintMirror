        "To get a curve with n+1 self-intersections, one can start from a curve with n self-intersections; identify the cycle of oriented edges that directly surrounds the finite extremity of the curve; choose an edge from that cycle and extend the curve so that it crosses that edge.",
        "When \"outside\" it might help visualization to imagine that a noncrossable oriented edge \"at infinity\" closes the cycle.",
        "Thus, for a transition between 0 and 1 self-intersection, the choice is between making a loop that turns left and making a loop that turns right; so a(1) = 2.",
