        "The decompositions for 1 are infinite and trivial, obtained letting k=1 and m arbitrary. The representations for the other entries are 127 = 64^2 - 63^2 = 7^3 - 6^3 = 2^7 - 1^7, 3367 = 1684^2 - 1683^2 = 34^3 - 33^3 = 4^6 - 3^6, 14911 = 7456^2 - 7455^2 = 71^3 - 70^3 = 16^4 - 15^4. Apparently there are no other solutions < 10^9."
