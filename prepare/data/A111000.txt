        "Consider a function f(x) = zeta(x) - 1/(x-1). Lim_{x->infinity} f(x) = 1 and lim_{x->1} f(x) = 0.577... is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. f(x) is strictly increasing, so the range of f(x) on the interval (1, infinity) is (0.577..., 1). a(n) is necessarily greater than or equal to b(n) when f(zeta(n)) >= 1/2. This is the case for n>1. Therefore, a(n) >= b(n).",

Lim_{x->1} g(x) = .577... is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. b(n) is necessarily greater than or equal to c(n) when g(zeta(n)) > 1/2. This is the case for n>3. Since b(2) = c(2) and b(3) = c(3), this proves b(n) >= c(n).",
        "Consider a function h(x) = zeta(x) - gamma(x-1). Lim_{x->1} h(x) = 1.154... is twice the Euler-Mascheroni constant. On the interval (1, 2], h(x) is strictly decreasing and has values on the interval [Pi^2/6-1 = 0.644..., 1.154...). a(n) - c(n) is necessarily less than or equal to 1 when h(zeta(n)) < 2.
