        "Dinculescu notes that if N = m^2 > 1 is a twin rank (i.e., in A002822), then m is always a multiple of 5, and if N = m^3 > 1, then m is a multiple of 7, cf. A326234. He asks whether there are other pairs (a, b) different from (5, 2) and (7, 3) such that all twin ranks m^b > 1 are of the form m = a*n. (Of course (5, 2) and (7, 3) imply that (5, 2k), (7, 3k) and (35, 6k) is such a pair for any k.) This sequence lists the n for (a, b) = (5, 2), see A326232 for the numbers m.",
