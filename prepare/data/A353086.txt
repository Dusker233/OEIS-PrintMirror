Then its Tribonacci successor n_2 has Tribonacci representation t0 (such numbers are in column 2 of the Trithoff array), and the successor of the successor n_3 has Tribonacci representation t00 (such numbers are in column 3 of the Trithoff array). The seed in the same row as n_1, n_2, and n_3 is 2n_2-n_3."
