        "Every term has 8 odd divisors and has either the form 2^k * p * q^3, k > 0, p < q primes, 2 < p < 2^(k+1) < 2^(k+1) * p < q or the form 2^k * p * q * r, k > 0, p < q < r primes, with the same 4 inequalities for p and q together with 2^(k+1) * p * q < r.",
        "The inequalities for either form ensure that the eight 1's in row(a(n)) of the triangle in A237048 are in positions 1, p, 2^(k+1), 2^(k+1) * p, q, p*q, 2^(k+1) * q and 2^(k+1) * p * q <= floor( (sqrt(8*a(n)+1) - 1)/2 ). Together with the fact that q^2 and r, respectively, are greater than row(a(n)) this establishes width pattern 12101210 for SRS(a(n)) up to the diagonal.",
        "The forms 2^k * p^7 and 2^k * p^3 * q, k > 0 and 2 < p < 2^(k+1) < q, with 8 odd divisors cannot occur since their width patterns start with 1212 ... ."
