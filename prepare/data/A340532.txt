        "Basically, for n = 1, 2, ..., 513, the terms a(n) are calculated by the double product formula in the program below, with the help of the authors' C# program using the BigInteger and BigFloat classes. (The computer calculations took 44 hours to complete.)",
        "Alternatively, the value of a(513) is calculated by the homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 256; the thus calculated value coincides with the one obtained by the classical double product formula. Furthermore, using the recurrence relation, the values of a(514), a(515), ..., a(10240) are also calculated. (The computer calculations took 4 minutes to complete.)"
