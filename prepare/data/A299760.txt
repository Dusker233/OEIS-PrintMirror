        "Let A,B,X respectively, represent A288189, A295185, A056240. For prime p with index k >= 3, A(p) = X(t)(rp-t) for some multiple r >= 1 of p, and some integer t such that rp-t is prime; then sopfr(A(p)) = rp. Similarly B(p) = X(g)(p-g) where g = p-q for some prime q < p, where q = p-g is the greatest prime divisor of A295185(p); then sopfr(B(p)) = p. A(p) < B(p) if r and t exist such that (rp-t) is prime, with X(t)(rp-t) < X(g)(p-g), otherwise r = 1, t = g and A(p) = B(p). So A(p) <= B(p) and this sequence lists primes p for which this equality holds. All primes for which g = 2 or 4 are in this sequence, since then both 2(p-2), 4(p-4) are < 3(2p-3), the minimum possible value for any r > 1, t of X(t)(rp-t). Equivocal results are found for g >= 6, though in the great majority of cases (up to k=400), g > 6 ==> A(p) < B(p)."
