        "If f(x) is a polynomial in x then the central difference f(x+1/2) - f(x-1/2) = 2*sinh(D/2)(f(x)) = D(f(x)) + (1/24)*D^3(f(x)) + (1/1920)*D^5(f(x)) + ..., where D denotes the differential operator d/dx. Formulas for higher central differences in terms of powers of the operator D can be obtained from the expansion of powers of the function 2*sinh(x/2). For example, the expansion (2*sinh(x/2))^2 = x^2 + (1/12)*x^4 + (1/360)*x^6 + .. leads to the second central difference formula f(x+1) - 2*f(x) + f(x-1) = D^2(f(x)) + (1/12)*D^4(f(x)) + (1/360)* D^6(f(x)) + ....
