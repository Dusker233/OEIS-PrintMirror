        "Avgustinovich, Fon-Der-Flaas, and Frid, define arithmetical complexity of a sequence t as the number of distinct subwords of length n formed by taking terms in arithmetic progression, so t(s), t(s+d), t(s+2*d), ..., t(s+(n-1)*d), each term a step d>=1 apart.  For d=1, these are the ordinary subwords (factors) so that arithmetical complexity >= factor complexity, which here is a(n) >= A337120(n)."
