        "The partition transform in A007213 expands m=5k as 1/(1-x^m) = 1 + x^m + x^2m + ..., whereas the transform here expands it as 1 + x^m.  Thus, if m appears as an argument to the transform, a difference will occur at n=2m due to a difference in coefficient at x^2m. The smallest such m in A007212 (and A027595) is 25, which explains why this sequences differs from A007213 from n=50 onward. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Nov 10 2019"
