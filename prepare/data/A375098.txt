    "comment": [
        "To determine how \"cube-like\" a Pythagorean quad is, we use the quotient C/(C-a*b*c) where C is the volume of an ideal cube for a given diagonal d, C=(d/sqrt(3))^3. A ratio of 100 indicates that the best {a,b,c} combination creates a solid 1 part per 100 smaller than the ideal cube volume.",
        "Contains all the terms in A001835 and A079935 except the leading 1s. For such a term b(m) contained in a(n) from those sequences, 2*b(m) will tie the current record, while 3*b(m) will tie but will also break the current record exactly half the time and thus appear as a(n+1). This means round((2+sqrt(3))*b(m)) will also be in the sequence as either a(n+1) or a(n+2) if a better quad for 3*b(n) was found.",
        "The constant (2+sqrt(3)) follows from the recurrence relationship b(n)=4*b(n-1)-b(n-2). The constant can be represented as the continued fraction 3,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,.... The equivalents for the 2D case (A001653) are 3+2*sqrt(2) and {5,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,...}.",
        "We conjecture this method provides complete solutions. This was confirmed directly by brute-force testing up to 1e7 (optimized using the sum-of-two-squares theorem for a given d^2-a^2 = b^2 + c^2; see link below)."
