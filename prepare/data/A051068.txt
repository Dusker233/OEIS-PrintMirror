        "The answer to Joerg Arndt's question is: yes (modulo an offset).  To see this, it suffices to prove that the two sequences of first differences Da and Db of a= A051068 and b:=A050294 are equal. Clearly the sequence Da of first differences of a is the sequence A014578. According to Philippe Deleham (2004), Da equals 0x = 0110110111110..., where x is the fixed point of the morphism 0->111, 1->110.",
        "From _Vladimir Shevelev_ (2011) we know a formula for b=A050294: b(n) = n-b(floor(n/3)). This gives that the sequence of first differences Db:=(b(n+1)-b(n)) of b satisfies",
        "      Db(3m+1) = Db(3m+2) = 1, and Db(3m+3) = 1 - Db(m).",
        "This implies that Db = x, the fixed point of 0->111, 1->110.",
