    "comment": [
        "A completely symmetric tree with 2^n leaves is a tree recursively defined by subdividing the root into two descendant branches with equally many leaves. The number of coalescent histories for matching completely symmetric trees with 2^n leaves can be determined from a bivariate recursion that considers completely symmetric trees with 2^(n-1) leaves (Rosenberg 2007, Theorem 3.1)."

The 4 coalescent histories, representing the vector of the images of gene tree nodes ((A,B), (C,D), ((A,B),(C,D)) in the species tree, are (3,3,3), (1,3,3), (3,2,3), and (1,2,3)."
