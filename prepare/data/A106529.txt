        "It seems that the ratio between successive terms tends to 1 as n increases, meaning perhaps that most numbers are in this sequence.",
        "The number of terms that have the k-th prime as their largest prime factor is A000984(k), the k-th central binomial coefficient. E.g., 6 and 9 are the A000984(2)=2 terms in {a(n)} that have prime(2)=3 as their largest prime factor.",
        "The sequence contains the positive integers m such that the rank of the partition B(m) = 0. For m >= 2, B(m) is defined as the partition obtained by taking the prime decomposition of m and replacing each prime factor p with its index i (i.e., i-th prime = p); also B(1) = the empty partition. For example, B(350) = B(2*5^2*7) = [1,3,3,4]. B is a bijection between the positive integers and the set of all partitions. The rank of a partition P is the largest part of P minus the number of parts of P. - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 09 2015",
