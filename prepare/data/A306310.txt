        "All terms are composite because for odd primes p we always have 2^((p-1)/2) == (2/p) = A091337(p) (mod p).",
        "All terms are congruent to 5 modulo 8. So this sequence is equivalent to \"Numbers k == 5 (mod 8) such that 2^((k-1)/2) == 1 (mod k)\".",
        "Proof: in the following proof let p be any prime factor of k. Note that 2 is a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if p == 1, 7 (mod 8).",
        "(a) if k == 3 (mod 8), then 2^((k-1)/2) == 1 (mod p), so 2^((k+1)/2) == 2 (mod p). Let x = 2^((k+1)/4), then x is an integer such that x^2 == 2 (mod p), so 2 is a quadratic residue modulo p => p == 1, 7 (mod 8). Since any prime factor of k is congruent to 1, 7 modulo 8 we have k == 1, 7 (mod 8), a contradiction.",
        "(b) if k == 7 (mod 8), then 2^((k-1)/2) == -1 (mod p). If p == 7 (mod 8), then 2 is a quadratic residue modulo p while -1 is not, a contradiction. If p == 5 (mod 8), let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p. 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo p, so d divides p - 1 but d does not divide (p - 1)/2, so v2(d) = v2(p-1) = 2, where v2 = A007814 is the 2-adic valuation. On the other hand, 2^(k-1) == 1 (mod p), so d divides k - 1, but k - 1 == 2 (mod 4), a contradiction. So p == 1, 3 (mod 8). Since any prime factor of k is congruent to 1, 3 modulo 8 we have k == 1, 3 (mod 8), a contradiction.",
        "(c) if k == 1 (mod 8), then 2^((k-1)/2) == -1 (mod p). Let x = 2^((k-1)/8), then x^4 == -1 (mod p), so -1 is a quartic residue modulo p => p == 1 (mod 8). Let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p, then d divides k - 1 but d does not divide (k-1)/2, so v2(d) = v2(k-1). On the other hand, 2^((p-1)/2) == 1 (mod p), so d divides (p-1)/2. So v2(p-1) >= v2(d) + 1 = v2(k-1) + 1. Let t = v2(k-1), then k - 1 is not divisible by 2^(t+1), but any prime factor p of k should have p - 1 is divisible by 2^(t+1), a contradiction.",
