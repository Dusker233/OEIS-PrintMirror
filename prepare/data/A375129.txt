(One could also slide the side AB below CD, but this sequence would not distinguish that new dissection from (1) because it would be equivalent to the mirror image of (1).) However, A049021 views these two dissections as equivalent. A375130 and A375132 distinguish between these dissections but do not include dissection (2) at all because it has an \"alignment\": two internal sides AB and CD, even though they are not connected through a 4-way junction (or a sequence of sides with the same orientation, connected through 4-way junctions), still extend to coinciding lines."
