    "comment": [
        "A binary carry of two positive integers is an overlap of the positions of 1's in their reversed binary expansion. An integer partition is binary carry-connected if the graph whose vertices are the parts and whose edges are binary carries is connected.",
        "The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k), so these are numbers whose prime indices are binary carry-connected. A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798."
