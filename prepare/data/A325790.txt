        "A circular subsequence is a sequence of consecutive non-overlapping terms where the last and first parts are also considered consecutive. The only circular subsequence of maximum length is the sequence itself (not any rotation of it). For example, the circular subsequences of (2,1,3) are: (), (1), (2), (3), (1,3), (2,1), (3,2), (2,1,3)."
