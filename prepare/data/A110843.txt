        "Noting that a(6) = a(5)*(10^2+1) and a(7) = a(5)*(10^4+1), we can derive an upper bound for a(n), n>7, of 24024*(10^x+1), where x is the smallest power that gives the number (10^x+1) exactly (n-5) factors-greater-than-13. For n = {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}, this would be x = {10, 14, 16, 36, 30, 55, 45, 77, 70}. I think this upper limit exists for all n, so a(n) always exists. - _Hans Havermann_, Sep 26 2005",
