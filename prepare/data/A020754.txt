        "We only consider gaps that set new records. The first gap of size 12 occurs (at 221167421) before the first gap of size 11 (at 262315466) and so for n>10, the n-th term in this sequence does not correspond to the first gap of length n. See A020753.  - _Nathan McNew_, Dec 02 2020",
        "The length of these runs are significantly shorter than would be predicted by a naive random model (for such a model see, e.g., Gordon, Schilling, & Waterman). For example, with n = a(18) and p = 6/Pi^2 the expected largest run is about 77.9 with variance 6.7, while A020753(18) = 18 which is 23 standard deviations smaller. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 29 2021"
