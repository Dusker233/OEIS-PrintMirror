        "For any n > 3, an upper bound for this problem is given by U(n) := (t + 1)*n^(n - 3) - 1, where \"t\" is the best known solution for the corresponding n X n X n case, and (for any n > 5) t = floor((3/2)*n^2) - floor((n - 1)/4) + floor((n + 1)/4) - floor((n - 2)/4) + floor(n/2) + n - 2 (e.g., U(4) = 95, since 23 is the current upper bound for the 4 X 4 X 4 problem). In particular, it is easily possible to prove the existence of an Hamiltonian path without self crossing such that U(4) = 95 (in fact, an Hamiltonian path with link-length 23 for the 4 X 4 X 4 problem was explicitly shown in June 2020).",
