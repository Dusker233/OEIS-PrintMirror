However, after the first three terms where a(n)/n = 6 -- a function which would increase to infinity if the asymptotic density were zero -- it drops, and it seems to take a long time to get that high again. The first time it gets above 5.0 is at a(30243)=151216. Even as high as a(2188516)=10000000, the density is only ~1/4.57.",
