        "This sequence indexes the smallest number m = A334769(k) that, when expressed in binary b(k), generates a rotationally symmetrical XOR-triangle (RST) that features a central zero-triangle (CZT) with frame width n.",
        "A \"frame width\" is the number of iterations j required to generate the first run of zeros in a CZT of an RST.",
        "Let L = A070939(m) for m in A334769. For RSTs, j > 1, since a solid run of L 1s given a recursive XOR function applied to each pair of adjacent bits, would give rise to a solid run of (L - 1) zeros in the next iteration, and every iteration thereafter consists of zeros. Therefore m = (2(L - 1) - 1) is not rotationally symmetrical except when L = 1.",
        "Sequence A334556 lists numbers m that produce RSTs; A334769 those RSTs that feature CZTs. Sequence A334796 renders the frame widths j for numbers in A334769.",
        "For n = 7, A070939(a(n)) > 3(7) + 1 = 22, but is likely much larger, given a(6). a(7) is likely a number with more than 40 bits."
