        "Let p = prime(n). Then a(n) = p*k, where k is the least practical number such that sigma(k)+1 >= p.",
        "Proof: By Stewart's theorem (see link), since a(n) is practical, each prime factor of a(n) is at most 1 plus the sum of divisors of the product of the smaller primes in a(n). In particular, dividing a(n) by its largest prime factor will leave a practical number, since the criterion applies inductively on the product of smaller primes, so if the largest prime factor of a(n) is greater than p or the exponent of p is greater than 1, then a(n) can be reduced to a smaller multiple of p and is thus not minimal.",
