        "The idea is each branch is treated as a path P_(n+2). Each branch acts independently then and has F(n+1) covers (P_n has F(n-1) covers), hence F(n+1)^4 total. Except we remove the cases where each branch is missing the connecting edge to the center, which is when that edge cover comes from P_n , hence the minus F(n-1)^4."
