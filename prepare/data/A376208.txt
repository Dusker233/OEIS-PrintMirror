        "This sequence is not A094178 \\ A375750, because there are hypotenuses for which both kinds of triangles exist. The smallest example occurs for hypotenuse c = 4*a(5) + 1 = 65. The triangle (16, 63, 65) has an even short leg, but there is also the triangle (33, 56, 65) with an odd short leg. Thus, 16 = (65-1)/4 is a term in this sequence and in A375750.",
