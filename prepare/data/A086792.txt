        "The only Abelian groups with this property are the cyclic groups C_n where n is a perfect number, so this sequence can be seen as a groups analogy of perfect numbers.",
        "Derek Holt (mareg(AT)mimosa.csv.warwick.ac.uk) computed the orders of the non-Abelian groups in the sequence up to n=500 and commented \"In general, if 2^n - 1 is a Mersenne prime, then 2^(n-1)*(2^n - 1) is a perfect number and the group with presentation < x,y | x^(2^n-1) = 1, y^(2^n) = 1, y^-1 x y = x^-1 > has order equal to the sum of the orders of its proper normal subgroups.\" So if n is an even perfect number, 2n also belongs to this sequence (the numbers 12 and 56 above)."
