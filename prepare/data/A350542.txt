        "Subsequence of A014574. For x>6, d=30 is the least possible difference between the least and the greatest of four twins. With d=24, six primes would have the form 6*k+-1, 6*k+6+-1,6*k+12+-1 which is impossible because one of the six numbers would be divisible by 5. Therefore, d>24, except for x=6. The distribution of 1134 terms < 10^11 is in accordance with the k-tuple conjecture, see links \"k-tuple conjecture\" and A350541, \"Test of the k-tuple conjecture\".",
