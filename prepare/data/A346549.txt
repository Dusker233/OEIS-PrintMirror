        "Runs of length bigger than 3 are impossible as one of four consecutive numbers is divisible by 4.",
        "The existence of consecutive pairs of such numbers is connected with primes of the form (p*q +- 1)/2 where p and q are odd primes.",
        "From _Michael S. Branicky_, Sep 21 2021: (Start)",
        "This only differs from the supersequence A038456 in the terms 26, 27 (present there but not here).",
        "Proof. Numbers with 4 divisors are of the form p*q for p, q prime, p != q or of the form r^3 for r prime.  For two such numbers to be consecutive terms of A038456 (but not terms here) requires p*q + 1 = r^3 or p*q = r^3 + 1 for primes p, q, r, p != q.  There is no solution to either form with p, q distinct primes for r = 2. Thus, r^3 is odd and p*q must be even, so wlog p = 2. Thus, we need to solve for case 1: 2*q + 1 = r^3 for q, r prime. But r^3 - 1 = (r - 1)*(r^2 + r + 1), so r = 3 is the only prime solution producing the factor 2, leading to the pair 26, 27. Likewise, case 2: r^3 + 1 = (r + 1)*(r^2 - r + 1) has no solution with prime r producing the required factor 2. (End)"
