    "comment": [
        "A055932 lists numbers m whose prime divisors p are consecutive primes starting with 2, while A025487 lists numbers m that are products of primorials. With both, we find a range of indices of primes 1, 2, ..., k that divide m. While A055932 admits any multiplicity for primes regardless of their index, the latter only admits decreasing multiplicities as prime index k increases. Therefore, A025487 is a subset of A055932."
