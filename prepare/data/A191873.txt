        "Well, it is well known from A001197 that a(8)<25. A001197 is essentially the same problem, but increased by 1, and without restricting the diagonals. The diagonal restriction is however of little interest, because it's easy to permute rows and columns and get all 0's or all 1's or probably any of the 2^n possible settings of the diagonal. At least, this is true when n=8; hence a(8) in this sequence is 24.",
