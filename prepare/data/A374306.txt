    "comment": [
        "A growing self-avoiding walk (GSAW) is a walk on a graph that is directed, does not visit the same vertex twice, and for which all neighbors of the endpoint are part of the walk, i.e., the endpoint is trapped. This sequence is about GSAWs on the grid graph of integer points (x,y) where x >= 0 and y is in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}. The GSAW must start at the point (0,0). The displacement of a GSAW is the difference between the largest and smallext x-values that it reaches."
