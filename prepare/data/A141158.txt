        "Yes, this is a duplicate of A038872. For primes p congruent to {1, 4} mod 5, they split in the ring Z[(1+sqrt(5))/2]. Since Z[(1+sqrt(5))/2] is a UFD, they are reducible in Z[(1+sqrt(5))/2], so we have p = e*((a + b*sqrt(5))/2)*((a - b*sqrt(5))/2), where a and b have the same parity and e = +-1. WLOG we can suppose e = 1, otherwise substitute a, b by (a+5*b)/2 and (a+b)/2. Now we show that there exists integer u, v such that p = (u + v*sqrt(5))*(u - v*sqrt(5)) = u^2 - 5*v^2.",

        "Hence every prime congruent to {1, 4} mod 5 is of the form u^2 - 5*v^2. On the other hand, u^2 - 5*v^2 == 0, 1, 4 (mod 5). So these two sequences are the same.",
