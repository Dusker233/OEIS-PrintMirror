        "A decorated permutation of length n is a word w=w_1...w_n on the letters {0,...,n} such that the restriction of w to its nonzero entries is an ordinary permutation in one-line notation. Then w avoids the pattern 001 if there is no subword w_{i_1}w_{i_2}w_{i_3} with i_1 < i_2 < i_3 such that w_{i_1}=w_{i_2} = 0 and w_{i_3} > 0.",
