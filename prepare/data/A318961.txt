        "The 2-adic integers are very different from p-adic ones where p is an odd prime. For example, provided that there is at least one solution, the number of solutions to x^n = a over p-adic integers is gcd(n, p-1) for odd primes p and gcd(n, 2) for p = 2. For odd primes p, x^2 = a is solvable iff a is a quadratic residue modulo p, while for p = 2 it's solvable iff a == 1 (mod 8). If gcd(n, p-1) > 1 and gcd(a, p) = 1, then the solutions to x^n = a differ starting at the rightmost digit for odd primes p, while for p = 2 they differ starting at the next-to-rightmost digit. As a result, the formulas and the program here are different from those in other entries related to p-adic integers."
