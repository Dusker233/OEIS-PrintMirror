    "comment": [
        "Consider a self-avoiding walk on a 2D square lattice where each visited node is given a fixed mass and each node is connected by a rod of another fixed mass. Hang the resulting lattice structure from a string at the first node. This sequence gives the number of walks of length n such that the structure will hang perfectly vertically, and will return to this position if perturbed.",
        "For a walk to be stable requires the torque around the first node to be zero for both the node and rod masses, and that the overall center of mass of the structure is lower than the first node. As n increases the number of walks satisfying these conditions decreases rapidly. For example the total number of 2D self-avoiding walks on a square lattice in the lower two quadrants for n=27 is A116903(27) = 227399388019. The total number of hanging stable walks for n=27 is 95995579, indicating only one in about 2370 walks is stable.",
        "For all stable walks it is found that the final node is always directly underneath the starting node. This is not the case if only the node or rod masses are considered.",
