        "The depth level of a rational in the Calkin-Wilf tree is the sum of its continued fraction terms, with the root (1/1) as level 1 for this purpose.  So the present sequence is partial sums of the continued fraction terms of e (A003417).  Depth levels are the same in the related trees Stern-Brocot, Bird, etc. - _Kevin Ryde_, Dec 26 2020"
