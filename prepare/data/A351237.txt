        "There are only 15 numbers k such that there exist numbers M_k which, when 1 is placed at both ends of M_k, the number M_k is multiplied by k; 83 is the eleventh such integer, so 83 = A329914(11), and a(1) = A329915(11) = 137; hence, the terms of this sequence form the infinite set {M_83}.",
        "Every term M = a(n) has q = 8*n-5 digits, and 10^(q+1)+1 that has q = 8*n-5 zeros in its decimal expansion is equal to 73 * M, so a(n) = M is a divisor of 10^(8*n-4)+1. Example: a(2) = 13698630137 has 11 digits and 73 * 13698630137 = 1000000000001 that has 11 zeros in its decimal expansion."
