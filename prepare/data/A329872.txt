        "We can have a list of nontotients and their factorizations into two totients. A totient m is in A301587 if and only if m never occurs in this list as a divisor of the nontotients. Using the list, many totients (10, 22, 44, 46, ...) are ruled out of A301587. But generally it's hard to prove that a number is in A301587."
