        "A polyming is a generalized polyiamond whose cells may be joined at corners as well as at edges.  I introduced the term in 2010.  In A319324 and elsewhere, David Bevan calls these shapes \"polyglasses.\" In A239658, Abe Wits and Ragnar Groot Koerkamp call them simply \"triangular polyplets.\""
