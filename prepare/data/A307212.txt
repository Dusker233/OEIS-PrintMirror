        "The Lucas cube Lambda(n) can be defined as the graph whose vertices are the binary strings of length n without either two consecutive 1's or a 1 in the first and in the last position, and in which two vertices are adjacent when their Hamming distance is exactly 1.",
        "The Narumi-Katayama index of a connected graph is the product of the degrees of the vertices of the graph."
