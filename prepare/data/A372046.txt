    "comment": [
        "A number 999...9998 will be a term if it has two prime factors 2 and 4999...999. Therefore 999999999999998 and 999...9998 (with 54 9's) are both terms. See A056712."

    "example": [
        "998 is a term as 998 = 2 * 499 = \"2\" * \"994\" when each prime factor is reversed. This gives \"2994\", and 2994 is divisible by 998.",
        "15584 is a term as 15584 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 487 = \"2\" * \"2\" * \"2\" * \"2\" * \"2\" * \"784\" when each prime factor is reversed. This gives \"22222784\", and 22222784 is divisible by 15584."
