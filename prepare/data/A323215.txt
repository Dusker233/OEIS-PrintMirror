        "a is strongly prime to n if and only if a <= n is prime to n and a does not divide n-1. See the link to 'Strong Coprimality'. (Our terminology follows the plea of Knuth, Graham and Patashnik in Concrete Mathematics, p. 115.)",
        "From _Robert Israel_, Apr 02 2019: (Start)",
        "If there is at least one prime <= sqrt(n) that divides neither n nor n-1, then its square is strongly prime to n and not prime.  If there does not exist such a prime, then the first Chebyshev function theta(sqrt(n)) = sum_{p <= sqrt(n)} log(p) <= 2 log(n). Now it is known that theta(x) = x + O(x/log(x)), so this can't happen if n is sufficiently large.  Thus the sequence is finite.",
        "The largest n for which no such p exists appears to be 120.  There are none between 121 and 10^7.  It is possible that a sufficiently tight lower bound on theta together with a finite search can be used to prove that there are no other members of the sequence. (End)",
