        "Even numbers of the form 2p, p prime, that can be expressed as the sum of two primes in at least two ways as 2p = p + p = 3 + (2p-3). For example, 34 is in the sequence because 34 = 2*17 = 17 + 17 = 3 + 31. These are the only numbers that have Goldbach partitions with both a minimum and a maximum possible difference between their prime parts, i.e., |p-p| = 0 and |(2p-3)-3| = 2p-6 respectively. - _Wesley Ivan Hurt_, Apr 08 2018"
