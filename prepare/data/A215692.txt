        "This is to cubes A000578 as A215689 is to squares A000290.",
        "The n-th term has A000217(n) = n(n+1)/2 digits. We can conjecture that a(n) > 0 for all n > 1 and the terms converge to the concatenation of (c(1), c(2), c(3), ...) where c(k) is the smallest k digit cube, cf. formula. The number of such primes between a(n) and A340115(n) (the largest of this form) is (0, 2, 2, 9, 177, 6909, 570166, ...). (In particular, for n = 2 and 3, a(n) and A340115(n) are the only two primes of this form.) This is very close to what we expect, given the number of concatenations of cubes of the respective length (product of 10^(k/3)-10^((k-1)/3), k=1..n) and the density of primes in that range according to the PNT. - _M.
