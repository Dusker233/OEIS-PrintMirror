        "Numbers k such that both k and k + 1 are in A033948.",
        "Apart from the first four terms, numbers k such that there exists odd primes p, q and positive numbers u, v such that k = p^u, k + 1 = 2*q^v or k = 2*p^u, k + 1 = q^v.",
        "Let p be an odd prime. If 2*p^e - 1 is prime, then 2*p^e - 1 is a term. If 2*p^e + 1 is prime, then 2*p^e is a term. If (p^2^e + 1)/2 is prime, then p^2^e is a term. However it's not known whether there are infinitely many primes of the form 2*p^e +- 1 or (p^2^e + 1)/2.",
        "The case that k and k + 1 are both in this sequence is extremely rare. Only 11 such k are known: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 17, 25, 81, 241 and 3^541 - 2. It's possible that there are no further members. See A305237."
