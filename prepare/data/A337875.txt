        "As the multiplicativity of sigma(k) ensures an infinity of solutions to the general equation m = k*sigma(k) (see A337873), Leo Moser asked if k*sigma(k) = q*sigma(q) has an infinity of primitive solutions, in the sense that (k', q') is not a solution for any k' = k/d, q' = q/d, d>1 (see References and 3rd example).",

Hence, there exists an infinity of primitive solutions if the sequence A000043 of Mersenne exponents is infinite.",
        "There exist terms m in A337873 that have three solutions like A337873(16) = 333312 = 336 * sigma(336) = 372 * sigma(372) = 434 * sigma(434) whose solutions (336,372), (336,434) and (372,434) are not primitive, but _Jinyuan Wang_ has found some terms m in A337873 with 3 preimages as A337873(3266) = 18979440480 from which one pair is primitive and the two others not primitive [see example a(18)]."
