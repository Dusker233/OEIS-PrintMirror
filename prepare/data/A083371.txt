        "The original definition by Cloitre was: [Start from any initial value F(1) >= 2 and define F(n) as the largest prime factor of F(1)+F(2)+F(3)+...+F(n-1). The sequence contains the primes satisfying F(2*p)=p supposed F(1)=7. Conjecture: F(n)= n/2+O(log n) and the sequence is infinite.] _Don Reble_ showed Jan 22 2022 that these are the same primes p followed by a prime gap of q-p >=8, where q is the next prime after p: [",
