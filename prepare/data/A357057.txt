        "All terms are odd primes; some of them are repeated.",
        "Conjecture: This sequence has the pattern: a prime repeated, a run of m times primes standing alone, the next prime repeated, a run of m+1 times primes standing alone, ... . All primes will be repeated once or follow in sequence. We know that if A356886(2^n-1) = p1 then A356886(2^n+1) will be p1*p2. p2 will be the smallest possible prime such that p1*p2 is not yet in the sequence A356886, thus p2 = a(n). Let p1*pn be already in A356886 and pn < p2, then we know that p1*pn will be on a position A356886(2^n-(2^(k+1)-2)) with some k > 0. This should explain this pattern. - _Thomas Scheuerle_, Sep 14 2022"
