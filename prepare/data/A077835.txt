        "a(n) is the number of ways two opposing basketball teams could score a combined total of n points (counting one point free throws, two point field goals, and three point field goals) considering the order of the scoring as important. [From _Geoffrey Critzer_, Feb 07 2009]",

That is, number of length n permutations having no subsequences of length 4 in which the first element is larger than the third element, and the fourth element is larger than the second element. - _Sergey Kitaev_, Dec 08 2020"
