        "In A075053(m), the primes obtained as permutations of digits of m are counted several times if they can be obtained in several different ways. See sequence A076730 which uses A039993 instead, i.e., counting only different primes. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 11 2014",
        "The original data given for n = 3, 4, 5 was erroneously A007526(n). - Up to n = 6, a(n) = A076730(n), but the two will differ not later than for n = 10, where A134596(10) = 1123456789 gives a(10) >= 398100 = A075053(1123456789) > A039993(1123456789) = 362451 = A076730(10). The difference arises because each prime containing a single '1' will be counted twice by A075053, but only once by A039993. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 14 2019"
