        "The products of twin primes (A037074), and odd composite numbers with a single pes-sequence, i.e. parameter B = 1, are a subset of this sequence (Schick 2003, eq.1.6.2).",
        "Any element x in Zs* is said to be a \"semi-primitive root\", if the order of x modulo s is phi(s)/2, where phi(s) is the Euler phi-function (Lee 2013, def.1).",
        "If s is a cyclic semiprime, x is a generating element and k an integer, then the following reduced modulus denoted mod* returns all elements of Zs* in the interval ]0,s/2[, with mod* defined by x^k mod* s = min(+-x^k mod s) (Lee et al., 2018, def.2.3).",
