        "A height 1 degree n polynomial p(x) is considered equivalent to -p(x), p(-x), x^n * p(1/x). Together, these transformations (polynomial negation, variable negation, variable inversion) generate an equivalence relationship among height 1 degree n polynomials with nonzero constant term. Two equivalent polynomials have equivalent factorizations.",
        "If we consider only monic polynomials, equivalence classes can comprise 1, 2, or 4 different polynomials.",
        "Proof for n = 2k+1: There are 2*3^2k monic degree n height 1 polynomials with nonzero constant term. Of those, 2*3^k are transformed to themselves by p(0)*x^n*p(1/x). For odd degree monic polynomials, that is the only equivalence transformation that has a fixed point. The number of equivalence classes is thus 2*3^k/2 + (2*3^2k-2*3^k)/4 = 3^k*(3^k+1)/2.",

        "The number of equivalence classes is |A| + (|V-A|+|N-A|+|G-A|)/2 + |T-A-(V-A)-(N-A)-(G-A)|/4 = |A|+(|V|+|N|+|G|-3|A|)/2 + (|T|-|V|-|N|-|G|+2|A|)/4 = (|T|+|V|+|N|+|G|)/4.",
