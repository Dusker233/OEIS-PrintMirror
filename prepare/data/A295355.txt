        "This is a companion sequence to A295356. The sequence (primes only, without exact n for the first and last terms as well as the number of terms) was found by Bays and Hudson in 1978 (see references). The full sequence up to 10^15 contains 6 sign-changing zones with 2381904 terms in total with A(2381904) = 21113714560133 as the last one.",
