        "The lower asymptotic density of this sequence is larger than 1/18 = 0.0555... which is the density of its subsequence of numbers of the form 6*m where gcd(m, 6) = 1 and m > 1. Numerically, based on counts of terms below 10^n (A302993), it seems that this sequence has an asymptotic density which equals to about 0.070034... - _Amiram Eldar_, Feb 13 2021"
