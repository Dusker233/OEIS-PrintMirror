        "A product crescendo is a sequence of successive integers that can be written as products j * k where the j's form a strictly increasing sequence and the k's form a strictly decreasing sequence.",

        "Numbers that start long product crescendos, but are not necessarily of record length, are easy to find by testing numbers of the form 1 + m*lcm(1..k) for sufficiently large m and k. E.g., the ones that start at 13399626241 = 1 + 18592*lcm(1..16), 442452890881 = 1 + 36112*lcm(1..17), and 521688126961 = 1 + 2241*lcm(1..19) have lengths 37, 39, and 41 respectively. (End)",
