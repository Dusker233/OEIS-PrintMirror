        "Consider a strong Goldbach conjecture: every even number n >= 6 is a sum of two primes, the lesser of which is O((log(n))^2*log(log(n))) (cf. comment to A152522). The number of such representations for 2^k, trivially, is less than k^5 for k > k_0. Removing the maximal primes in every such representation of 2^k, k >= 3, we obtain an analog B of A152451 with the counting function H(x) = pi(x) - O((log(x))^5). Replacing in B the first N terms with N consecutive primes (with arbitrarily large N), we obtain a sequence which essentially is indistinguishable from the sequence of all primes with the help of the approximation of pi(x) by li(x), since, according to the well-known Littlewood result, the remainder term in the theorem of primes cannot be less than sqrt(x)logloglog(x)/log(x). But for this sequence we have infinitely many even numbers for which the considered strong Goldbach conjecture is wrong. Thus the conjecture is essentially unprovable."
