        "Terms in A323711 can be generated by inserting 9's and 0's under certain conditions (see comment in A323711). These are the terms that are not formed this way and can be considered primitive terms of A323711. The first term containing the digit 0 is a(15) = 157836042 and the first term containing the digit 9 is a(13) = 137965842.",
