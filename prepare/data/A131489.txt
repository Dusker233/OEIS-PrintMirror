        "_Max Alekseyev_ points out that every term of A066466, except 4, must be of the form 3*2^k such that 3*2^(k+1)-1, 3*2^(k+1)+1 are twin primes. There no such new k+1 (i.e., except known 1,2,6,18) below 1000. In other words, 3*2^n - 1, 3*2^n + 1 are twin primes for n=1,2,6,18. According to these tables: http://www.prothsearch.com/riesel1.html http://www.prothsearch.com/riesel2.html there are no other such n up to 18*10^6. Therefore the next term of A066466 (if it exists) is greater than 3*2^(18*10^6) ~= 10^5418540. Hence the next element of the anti-primorials (if it exists) is greater than 679477248 * 10^5418540 > 10^5418548. [Updated by _Max Alekseyev_, May 23 2023]"
