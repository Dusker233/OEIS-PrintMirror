        "In the plane, consider the parabola y=x^2. There are n squares \"strung\" on the y axis so that two vertices of each square lie on the axis of the parabola, and the other two belong to the parabola. In this case, the sizes of the squares are chosen so that the lower vertices of the squares have ordinates 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n - 1. See link."
