    "name": "a(n) is the number of essentially different ways in which the integers 1,2,3,...,n can be arranged in a sequence such that all pairs of adjacent integers sum to a prime number. Rotations and reversals are counted only once.",
    "comment": [
        "Note that when the first and last numbers of an arrangement sum to a prime, then there are n rotations that are treated as one arrangement. The case n=6 exhibits rotational solutions: {1,4,3,2,5,6}, which is actually a prime circle. See A051252 for more details about prime circles.",
        "The Mathematica program uses a backtracking algorithm to count the arrangements. To print the unique arrangements, remove the comments from around the print statement. It seems that a greedy algorithm can be used to quickly find a solution for any n."
