    "comment": [
        "No T-tetromino fits in a 1 X 1 or 2 X 2 square: a(1)=a(2)=0. A single T-tetromino can be placed in a 3 X 3 square, and must occupy the center square. Four T-tetrominos fit within a 4 X 4 square with no spaces left over, in a rotationally symmetric tiling: a(4)=4.",
        "For n = 4m, it is obvious that a(n) = n^2/4, by repeating the construction for n=4. For n = 4m + 2, it can be shown, using a chessboard coloring, that a(n) < n^2/4. By tiling an L-shaped strip of width 2 in a manner that can be indefinitely extended, one can show that a(n) = n^2/4 - 1.",
        "Shuxin Zhan proved that it is not possible to tile a square of side 4m+1 or 4m+3 with T-tetrominos and a single monomino. Thus there must be at least 5 empty squares in any partial tiling by T-tetrominos. This bound is achieved for tilings in 5 X 5, 7 X 7, 9 X 9 and 11 X 11 squares. Robert Hochberg proved that for n > 11, there must be either 5 or 9 empty squares. He conjectured that 5 is always enough.",
        "Jack W Grahl proved that, for squares, 5 monominos are always sufficient. This means that the sequence is given by n^2/4, (n^2-1)/4-1, n^2/4-1, (n^2-1)/4-1, for n = 4m, n = 4m+1, n = 4m+2 and n = 4m+3, respectively (which the exception of a(1) = 0), and generating function x^3*(-1-2*x+2*x^2-2*x^3+x^4) ) / ( (1+x)*(x^2+1)*(x-1)^3 ). - _Jack W Grahl_, Jul 25 2018"
