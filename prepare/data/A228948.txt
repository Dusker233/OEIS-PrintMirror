        "Cube root of perfect cubes in A087285 or in A229618 are in the present sequence, but this does not yield all terms, because these sequences require k^2 to be the largest square < m^3.",

In other words, numbers k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 - k^3 has solutions other than the trivial solution (k,0). - _Jianing Song_, Sep 24 2022"
