        "Empirically, it looks as if every number of the form (10^3^n-1)/9 has this property. - _David W. Wilson_, Dec 12 2001",
        "From _David A. Corneth_, Jan 23 2019: (Start)",
        "Indeed, (10^3^n-1)/9 is in the sequence. It has digital sum times product of digits equal to 3^n.",
        "Proof: (10^3^0-1)/9 = (10^1-1)/9 = 1 is in the sequence.",
        "If (10^3^k-1)/9 is in the sequence then (10^3^(k + 1)-1)/9 = ((10^3^k-1)/9) * (10^(2*3^k) + 10^(3^k) + 1) = 3 * m * ((10^3^k-1)/9) for some m. This number is divisible by 3 * 3^k = 3^(k + 1) so (10^3^(k+1) - 1)/9 is in the sequence and so (10^3^n - 1) / 9 is in the sequence from which it follows that the sequence is infinite. (End)"
