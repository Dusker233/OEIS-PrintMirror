    "comment": [
        "The hexagonal grid of size n, or side length n, consists of 2n-1 centered rows of respective length (number of cells or available grid points) n, n+1, ..., 2n-1, 2n-2, ..., n, for a total of A003215(n-1) = 3n(n-1) + 1 cells, cf. examples.",
        "The forbidden arithmetic progressions can also be stated by requiring that all 3-element subsets must be non-averaging, i.e., none of the three points can be the center or midpoint of the two other points.",
        "Lower bounds for the next terms are a(8) >= 52, a(9) >= 59, a(10) >= 68, a(11) >= 80. - _M. A. Achterberg_, Feb 10 2022"
