        "Only the 0th and 1st terms of this sequence are exact values of n-degrees in an n-sphere, by definition. The 0-sphere, being 2 disconnected points at the ends of a segment, is trivial.",
        "The number of degrees, minutes, seconds in an n-sphere is designed to approximate the size of an n-cube, m^n units in size, as m becomes increasingly small, observed from the center of the sphere. This makes a degree Pi/180 of a radian, a square degree (Pi/180)^2 of a steradian, a cubic degree (Pi/180)^3 of a 3-radian, etc.",

        "At n = 56058 the sequence has a value of 281 (actual number 281.4089), meaning the 56058-dimensional sphere has less than 360 degrees. At n = 56070, the function has a value of 0.6978855, turning the rest of the sequence into a string of zeros.",
