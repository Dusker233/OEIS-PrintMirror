        "These numbers m are the members of A079896 that have two conjugacy classes of proper solutions (and one of improper solutions) for the Pell equation x^2 - m*y^2 = +4. E.g., m = 5 has the proper positive fundamental solutions (3,1) and (7,3) obtained from (3,-1) (and the improper positive fundamental solution (18,8) = 2*(9,4) obtained from (2,0)).",
        "For these numbers m one has therefore two conjugacy classes of improper solutions, and, in addition, the improper ambiguous class with member (4, 0) for the equation X^2 - m*Y^2 = +16.",
        "Note that also even m may have solutions with both x and y odd, e.g., m = 12 with minimal positive solution (x, y) = (4, 1) for the +4 equation. The +-4 in the name means +4 or -4 (inclusive).",
