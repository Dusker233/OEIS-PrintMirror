        "Pollack (2011) proved that the asymptotic density of numbers k such that gcd(k, sigma(k)) > (log(log(k)))^u for a real number u > 0 is equal to exp(-gamma) * Integral_{t=u..oo} rho(t) dt, where rho(t) is the Dickman-de Bruijn function and gamma is Euler's constant (A001620). For this sequence u = 1, and therefore its asymptotic density is 1 - exp(-gamma) = 0.43854... (A227242).",
