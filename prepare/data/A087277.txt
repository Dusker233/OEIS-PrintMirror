    "comment": [
        "Schinzel's hypothesis H, if true, would imply that there are an infinite number of k that yield simultaneous primes. Note that the two first-degree cyclotomic polynomials, x-1 and x+1, yield the twin primes for the numbers in A014574.",

        "Suppose k == 1 (mod 3); then we have",

        "  k^2 + 1 == 2 (mod 3), and",

        "so k^2 + 1 - k cannot be prime if k == 2 (mod 3) (with the exception of k=2, which yields k^2 + 1 - k = 2^2 + 1 - 2 = 4+1-2 = 3, which is prime).",

        "  k^2 == 0 (mod 3) and",

        "Finally, if k == 1 (mod 2) for k > 2, then we have",
