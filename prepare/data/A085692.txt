        "The problem of whether there are any other terms in this sequence, Brocard's problem, has been unsolved since 1876. The known calculations give a(4) > (10^9)! = factorial(10^9). - _Stefan Steinerberger_, Mar 19 2006",
        "I wrote a similar program sieving against the 40 smallest primes larger than 4*10^9 and can report that a(4) > factorial(4*10^9+1). In other words, it's now known that the only n <= 4*10^9 for which n!+1 is a square are 4, 5 and 7. C source code available on request. - Tim Peters (tim.one(AT)comcast.net), Jul 02 2006",
        "Robert Matson claims to have verified that 4, 5, and 7 are the only values of n <= 10^12 for which n!+1 is a square. This implies that the next term, if it exists, is greater than (10^12+1)! ~ 1.4*10^11565705518115. - _David Radcliffe_, Oct 28 2019"
