        "In a multiset partition, two vertices are equivalent if in every block the multiplicity of the first is equal to the multiplicity of the second. The T_0 condition means that there are no equivalent vertices.",
        "The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices."
