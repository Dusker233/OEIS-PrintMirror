        "A173426(n) is the concatenation of all numbers from 1 up to k and then back down to 1. The prime terms of A173426 have been called \"memorable primes\" (see the Numberphile video). These \"unmemorable primes\" are a superset created by concatenating 1..k in ascending order followed by concatenating the numbers k-1..1 in descending order. Any primes found during either concatenation process are added to the sequence (e.g., k = 5, 1234543 is included. If 12345 were prime, it would be included as well)."
