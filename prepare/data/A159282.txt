    "comment": [
        "a(n) for n >= 2 may be defined as follows. For a full n-dimensional shift, let M(N) = Sum_{L} O(L)/exp(h[L]), where the sum is over subgroups L of finite index in Z^n, O(L) is the number of points with stabilizer L, and exp(h) is the number of symbols.",
        "Then M(N) is asymptotic to a rational times a power of Pi times a product of values of the zeta function at odd integers, and a(n) is the denominator of that rational."
