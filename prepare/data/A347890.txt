Proof: If sigma(k) > 2*k, and sigma(k) were even, then sigma(k)/2 would be an integer and a divisor of sigma(k), and we could compute A003415(sigma(k)) as A003415(2)*(sigma(k)/2) + 2*A003415(sigma(k)/2) by the definition of the arithmetic derivative. But that value is certainly larger than k, because sigma(k)/2 > k, therefore sigma(k) must be an odd number, with also its abundance sigma(k)-(2k) odd. This also entails that all terms are squares. See A347891 for the square roots.",
