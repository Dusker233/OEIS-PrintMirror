    "comment": [
        "The sequence is infinite, even if it is restricted to terms that end with a nonzero digit, as any term generates an infinite number of other terms by the following scheme: If m is a term of the sequence and d(m) denotes the number of digits of m, then set m' = m*10^d'+m with d' >= d(m). For d' >= d(m) we have reverse(m') = reverse(m)*10^d' + reverse(m) and thus (m')^2 + reverse(m')^2 = (m*10^d'+m)^2 + (reverse(m)*10^d'+reverse(m))^2 = (m^2+reverse(m)^2)*(10^d'+1)^2. As m^2+reverse(m)^2 is a perfect square by assumption, the product on the right-hand side of the equation is also a perfect square and m' is part of the sequence. The calculation works also with m' = m*(10^(k*d')+...+10^d'+1). As an example take a(1)=88209. All numbers 8820988209, 882098820988209, 88209882098820988209, ... and 88209088209, 882090088209, 8820900088209, ... are also terms of the sequence. - _Matthias Baur_, May 01 2020"
