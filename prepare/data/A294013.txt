        "Sum of the slopes of the tangent lines along the left side of the parabola b(x) = 2*n*x-x^2 at prime values of x for x in 0 < x <= n. For example, d/dx 2*n*x-x^2 = 2n-2x. So for a(6), the prime values of x are x=2,3,5 and so a(6) = 12-2*2 + 12-2*3 + 12-2*5 = 8 + 6 + 2 = 16. - _Wesley Ivan Hurt_, Mar 24 2018"
