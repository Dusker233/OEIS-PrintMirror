        "At the end of 2011 there was a 3-month programming competition (http://infinitesearchspace.dyndns.org/orchardplanting) for this problem for n in the range [11,60]. Later there was an unofficial contest (http://infinitesearchspace.dyndns.org/content/orchard-mini-contest) for finding optimal solutions that can be placed on the smallest possible grids.",
        "The terms in this sequences are the best known solutions to date and they may not be optimal.",
        "Any solution that can be represented with integer coordinates can also be represented with real-valued coordinates, hence A172992(n)<=A006065(n). It is believed (but not proved) that some real-valued solutions cannot be represented by integer-valued solutions. For example A172992(16)=14, but A006065(16)=15. (End)"
