        "All terms are multiples of 5 (and thus of 30), because when applied to any number which is a multiple of 6, but not of 5 (and thus not a multiple of 30, implying that the primorial expansion ends with \"x00\", where x <> 0, and A257993(n) = 3), A276086 will yield a number of the form 30k+5 or 30k+25 (A084967) whose primorial expansion ends either as \"...021\" or as \"...401\" (with the least significant zero either in position 2 or 3), thus A328578(n) = A257993(A276086(A276086(n))) cannot simultaneously be larger than 2 and smaller than A257993(n)."
