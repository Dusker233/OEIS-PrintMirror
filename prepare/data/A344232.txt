        "This is one of the bisections of sequence A343238. The other sequence is A344231.",

        "The reduced form [2, 2, 3] represents the proper (determinant +1) equivalence class of one of the two genera (genus II) of discriminant -20. The multiplicative generic characters for discriminant Disc = -20 have values Jacobi(a(n)|5) = -1 and Jacobi(-1|a(n)) = -1, for odd a(n) not divisible by 5. See Buell, p. 52.",
        "The product of any two odd a(n), not divisible by 5, is congruent to {1,5} (mod 8). See Buell, 4),  p. 51.",
        "For this genus II of Disc = -20 the positive integers represented are given by 2^a*5^b*Product_{j=1..PI} (pI_j)^(eI(j))*Product_{k=1..PII}(pII_k)^(eII(k)), with a and b from {0, 1}, but if PI = PII = 0 (empty products are 1) then (a, b) = (1, 0) or (1, 1), giving a(1) = 2 or a(4) = 10. The odd primes pI_j are from A033205 and the odd primes  pII_j from the odd primes of A106865. The exponents of the second product satisfy: if a = 1 then PII >= 0, and if PII >=1 then Sum_{k=1..PII} eII(j) is even. If a = 0 then PII >= 1 and this sum is odd.",
