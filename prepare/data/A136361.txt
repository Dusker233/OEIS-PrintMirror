        "Corresponding perfect squares in A136360 are a(n)^2 = {9, 25, 961, 17424, ...}. They correspond to the perfect fourth powers in A133459 = Sums of two nonzero pentagonal pyramidal numbers. a(n)^4 are the terms of A133459: {81, 525, 923521, 303595776, ...}. Note that the first three terms are prime.",
