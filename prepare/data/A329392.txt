    "comment": [
        "There are no perimeters p of primitive Pythagorean triangles all sides of which are squarefree. This is because one side is twice the product of two relatively prime numbers not both odd and therefore even.",
        "Many terms of this sequence can be obtained by scaling (3,4,5) the sides of the smallest primitive Pythagorean triangle. For example, a(1) = (3*39) + (4*11) + (5*25).",
        "a(6) is the first term of the sequence which cannot be obtained by scaling (3,4,5). In fact there is no primitive Pythagorean triangle smaller than a(6) that can be scaled to a(6) in the manner above, and in the context of this sequence a(6) can be thought of as \"primitive\".",
        "a(514) = 310464 is the smallest perimeter corresponding to two triangles, namely (3^2*7^2*263, 2^6*11*89, 5^2*5273) and (2^6*3^2*251, 7^2*11*37, 5*17^2*101). - _Giovanni Resta_, Nov 15 2019",
