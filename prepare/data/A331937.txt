        "Also Matula-Goebel numbers of semi-lone-child-avoiding locally disjoint rooted identity trees. A rooted tree is locally disjoint if no child of any vertex has branches overlapping the branches of any other (inequivalent) child of the same vertex. It is semi-lone-child-avoiding if there are no vertices with exactly one child unless that child is an endpoint/leaf. In an identity tree, the branches of any given vertex are all distinct. The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree is the product of primes indexed by the Matula-Goebel numbers of the branches of its root, which gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled rooted trees."
