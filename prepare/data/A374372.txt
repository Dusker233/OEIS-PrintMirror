        "There are infinitely many terms where the corresponding product has two factors. This can be seen by solving the equation A000326(x)=A000326(y)*A000326(z) for a fixed z for which a solution exists, leading to a generalized Pell equation. For example, z = 5 leads to the solutions (x,y) = (82,14), (1649982,278898), (33266933642,5623138102), ..., corresponding to the terms A000326(82) = 10045, A000326(1649982) = 4083660075495, A000326(33266933642) = 1660033310895213609425, ... in the sequence."
