        "Let k be a term of this sequence. Then consider the finite field of k elements, denoted by F_k. Adjoin the hyperbolic unit j^2 = 1 to F_k to form a ring whose elements are of the form a + bj for a, b in F_k. Let M be the multiplicative monoid of F_k[j] and let ~ be the equivalence relation on the elements of M defined by a + bj ~ b + aj (with no further unnecessary equivalences). Then M/~ is isomorphic to the multiplicative monoid of the ring F_k x F_(k+1)/2 and therefore there exists a ring with M/~ as its multiplication. For prime powers k not in this sequence, no such ring will exist."
