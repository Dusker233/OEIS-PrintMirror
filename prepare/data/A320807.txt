        "Also the number of nonnegative integer matrices up to row and column permutations with sum of entries equal to n and no zero rows or columns, in which each row and each column has relatively prime nonzero entries.",
        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.",
        "A multiset is aperiodic if its multiplicities are relatively prime.",
        "The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices."
