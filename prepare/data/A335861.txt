        "This polygon consists of a central equilateral triangle with a line of n adjacent squares connected to each of its three edges. This gives the polygon a total of one triangle, 3n squares, and 6n+3 vertices. Join every pair of vertices by a line segment, provided the line does not extend beyond the boundary of the polygon. The sequence gives the number of regions in the resulting figure."
