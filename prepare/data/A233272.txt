        "Write n in binary: 1ab..xyz, then a(n) = (1+1ab..xy) + (1+1ab..x) + ... + (1+1ab) + (1+1a) + (1+1) + (1+0) + 1. This method was found by LODA miner, see the assembly program at C. Krause link.",
        "Proof: Compare to a similar formula given for A011371, with a(n) = a(floor(n/2)) + floor(n/2) to the new formula for this sequence which is a(n) = 1 + a(floor(n/2)) + floor(n/2), for n > 0 and a(0) = 1. It is easy to see that the difference between these, a(n) - A011371(n) = 1+A070939(n), for n > 0. As A011371(n) = n minus (number of 1's in binary expansion of n), then a(n) = 1 + (number of digits in binary expansion of n) + (n minus number of 1's in binary expansion of n) = 1 + n + (number of nonleading 0's in binary expansion of n), which indeed is the definition of this sequence.",
