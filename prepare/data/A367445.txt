        "Number of discrete implications I:L_n^2-> L_n defined on the finite chain L_n={0,1,...n} satisfying the contrapositive symmetry with respect to some discrete negation N, i.e., the number of binary functions I:L_n^2->L_n such that I is decreasing in the first argument, increasing in the second argument, I(0,0)=I(n,n)=n and I(n,0)=0 (discrete implication), and I(x,y) = I(N(y), N(x)), for all x,y in L_n (contrapositive symmetry with respect to a discrete negation N). A discrete negation N:L_n->L_n is a decreasing operator with N(0)=n and N(n)=0."
