        "For any positive number with prime factorization Product_{k = 1..m} prime(k)^e_k (where prime(k) denotes the k-th prime number and e_m > 0), we build a XOR-triangle with (e_m, ..., e_1) as top row, and having each entry in the subsequent rows be the XOR of the two values above it. This sequence lists integers whose XOR-triangle has 3-fold rotational symmetry. A334990 gives the second row of such XOR-triangles for numbers that are not powers of 2.",
