    "comment": [
        "Prime septuplets (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12, p+18, p+20) are one of the two types of densest permissible constellations of 7 primes (A022009 and A022010). Average gaps between prime k-tuples can be deduced from the Hardy-Littlewood k-tuple conjecture and are O(log^k(p)), with k=7 for septuplets. If a gap is larger than any preceding gap, we call it a maximal gap, or a record gap. Maximal gaps may be significantly larger than average gaps; this sequence suggests that maximal gaps are O(log^8(p)).",
        "A201249 lists initial primes p in septuplets (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12, p+18, p+20) preceding the maximal gaps. A233425 lists the corresponding primes at the end of the maximal gaps."

    "formula": [
        "Gaps between prime septuplets (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12, p+18, p+20) are smaller than 0.02*(log p)^8, where p is the prime at the end of the gap. There is no rigorous proof of this formula. The O(log^8(p)) growth rate is suggested by numerical data and heuristics based on probability considerations."

    "example": [
        "The gap of 165690 between septuplets starting at p=11 and p=165701 is the very first gap, so a(1)=165690. The gap of 903000 between septuplets starting at p=165701 and p=1068701 is a maximal gap - larger than any preceding gap; therefore a(2)=903000. The next gap of 10831800 is again a maximal gap, so a(3)=10831800. The next gap is smaller, so it does not contribute to the sequence."
