        "This sequence is a subsequence of A060860 (the even terms) and a supersequence of A094835. All the terms of A094835 are in this sequence, but 130576328 is not in A094835. A094835 also shows that this sequence is infinite.",
        "Terms A076445(n)+1 are terms of this sequence because A076445(n) and A076445(n)+2 are powerful and A076445(n)+1)^2-1 = A076445(n) * (A076445(n)+2), which is also powerful."
