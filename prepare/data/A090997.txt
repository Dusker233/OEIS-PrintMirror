        "It appears that all terms that are divisible by p^2 and do not belong to A090943 are of the form 2*k*p^2, where p is a prime and k > 0 is an integer. Also, all numbers in A090943 are terms because they are divisible by the squares of irregular primes in A094095. The corresponding smallest primes p such that their squares divide terms are listed in A090987. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Aug 19 2006",
        "A subsequence of the current sequence is A122270, which are the numbers m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by a cube. Another subsequence of the current sequence is A122272, which are the numbers m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by p^4, where p is a prime. Note that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(6250) is divisible by 5^5. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Aug 28 2006"
