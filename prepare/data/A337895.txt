        "Each chiral pair is counted as two when enumerating oriented arrangements. Also called a 5-cell or pentachoron. The Schl\u00e4fli symbol is {3,3,3}, and it has 5 tetrahedral facets (vertices).",

Each is an even permutation of the vertices and can be associated with a partition of 5 based on the conjugacy class of the permutation. The first formula is obtained by averaging their cycle indices after replacing x_i^j with n^j according to the P\u00f3lya enumeration theorem.",
