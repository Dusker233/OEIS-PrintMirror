        "Also the number of terms in n-th string (starting from n=3) when representing A000002 as a tree. Each branch of this tree is a string.  Starting from n=3, each 1 in n-th string generates either 1 or 2 in (n+1)-th string and each 2 in n-th string generates either 11 or 22 in (n+1)-th string based on the previously generated term of either 2 or 1. Hence, the number of terms in (n+1)-th string is the sum of all terms in n-th string. - _Rakesh Khanna A_, May 24 2020"
