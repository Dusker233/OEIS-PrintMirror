    "comment": [
        "The n-th term of this sequence is by definition the order of the group of admissible positions of the n X n Rubik's Square. The group is generated by 2n elements of order 2: 180-degree rotations of n columns, and 180-degree rotations of n rows. It is naturally a subgroup of the symmetric group on n^2 symbols. The sequence was discovered by Carlos Aguirre during a semester project supervised by Sean D. Lawton.",
        "Proof of the formula: for any n>0, we split the square of 2n X 2n to four parts. It is easy to show that an element (x, y) has only four places to arrive: ((x, y), (2n-x+1,y), (x,2n-y+1) and (2n-x+1, 2n-y+1)), we call them a, b, c, d. By some rotation we can make any even permutation of abcd, without changing other elements. So we can pair rows i and (2n-i+1), and enumerate which of them are reversed by an odd number; and we can pair columns j and (2n-j-1), enumerate which of them are reversed by an odd number. Then each quad tuple (a, b, c, d) is determined to have an odd permutation, or even permutation; so they have 12 permutations to choose. This gives 12^(n^2) * 2^(2n) permutations, but reversing all columns and rows gives the same permutations, so there are 12^(n^2) * 2^(2n-1) permutations in total. - _Qingyu Ren_, Aug 12 2019"
