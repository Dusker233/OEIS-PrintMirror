        "a(n) is the position in lexicographic order of the n-th odd partition of a sufficiently large number k. As long as the number k whose partitions we are examining is large enough, a(n) will exist and won't change for different k. The number of partitions of an odd number, for example, 101 for k=13, will always appear in the sequence, since 13 is the 101st partition in lexicographic order."
