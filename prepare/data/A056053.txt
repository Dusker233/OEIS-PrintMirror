        "a(2) = 15 and a(3) = 113 are related to the Borwein integrals. Concretely, a(2) = 15 is the smallest odd m such that the integral Integral_{x=-oo..oo} Product_{1<=k<=m, k odd} (sin(k*x)/(k*x)) dx is slightly less than Pi, and a(3) = 113 is the smallest odd m such that the integral Integral_{x=-oo..oo} cos(x) * Product_{1<=k<=m, k odd} (sin(k*x)/(k*x)) dx is slightly less than Pi/2.
