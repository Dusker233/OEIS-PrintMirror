        "Using the formulae in C. G. Bower's web link below about transforms, it can be proved that, for k >= 2, the BHK[k] transform of sequence (e(n): n >= 1), which has g.f. E(x) = Sum_{n >= 1} e(n)*x^n, has generating function B_k(x) = (1/2)*(E(x)^k - E(x^2)^{k/2}) if k is even, and B_k(x) = E(x)*B_{k-1}(x) = (E(x)/2)*(E(x)^{k-1} - E(x^2)^{(k-1)/2}) if k is odd. For k=1, Bower assumes that the BHK[k=1] transform of (e(n): n >= 1) is itself, which means that the g.f. of the output sequence is E(x). (This assumption is not accepted by all mathematicians because a sequence of length 1 is not only reversible but palindromic as well.)",
        "For this sequence, e(n) = 1 for all n >=1, and so E(x) = x/(1-x). We have a(n) = BHK[n]((e(n): n >= 1))(2*n) = (2*n)-th element of the output sequence of the BHK[n] transform of (1, 1, 1, ...).",
        "For k = 2*m (with m >= 1), we have B_k(x) = (x^k/2)*(1/(1-x)^k - 1/(1-x^2)^{k/2}) = (x^k/2)*(Sum_{s >= 0} C(k+s-1, s)*x^s - Sum_{s >= 0} C((k/2)+s-1, s)*x^(2*s)). This implies a(2*m) = (1/2)*(C(4*m-1, 2*m) - C(2*m-1, m)) = (1/4) * (C(4*m, 2*m) - C(2*m, m)), which is one of Bower's formulae below.",
        "For k = 2*m+1 (with m >= 1), we have B_k(x)=(x^k/2)*(1/(1-x))*((1/(1-x)^(k-1) - 1/(1-x^2)^{(k-1)/2}). Using Taylor expansions and series manipulations (details are omitted), we get that the coefficient of the (2*(2m+1))-th term of B_{2m+1}(x) is a(2*m+1) = (1/2)*(Sum_{0 <= s <= 2*m+1} C(2*m+s-1, s) - Sum_{0 <= s <= m} C(m+s-1, s)) = (1/2)*(C(4*m+1, 2*m+1) - C(2*m, m)). (This formula is not true for m = 0 because a(1) = 1. See the comment above about the BHK[k=1] transform.)",
