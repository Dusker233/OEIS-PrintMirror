        "Any number having an odd number of divisors is a square, so each term in this sequence is a term of A001110 (numbers that are both triangular and square). Since A001110(k) = (A000129(k)*A001333(k))^2, A001110(k) will have exactly 9 divisors iff A000129(k) and A001333(k) are both prime (i.e., k is in both A096650 and A099088); the first 5 values of k at which this occurs are 2, 3, 5, 29, and 59.",
