        "Yes. Construct a Ferrers diagram by placing odd parts horizontally and even parts vertically in a fishbone pattern. The resulting Ferrers diagram will be for an ordinary partition and the process is reversible. It does not appear that this method can be applied to give a formula for this sequence. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 25 2021"
