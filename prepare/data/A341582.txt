    "comment": [
        "Scorer, Grundy and Smith define a variation of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle where the smallest disk moves freely and two disks can exchange positions when they differ in size by 1, are on different pegs, and each is topmost on its peg.  The puzzle is to move a stack of n disks from one peg to another.",
        "Stockmeyer et al. show the shortest solution to the puzzle is f(n) = A341579(n) steps.  They offer as an exercise for the reader to prove that the number of exchanges made within the solution is f(n-1) and the remaining a(n) = f(n) - f(n-1) here is the number of simple moves of the smallest disk (move-only, not exchange)."
