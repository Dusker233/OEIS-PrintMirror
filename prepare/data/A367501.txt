        "Conway and Sloane identify 2 conjugacy classes of maximal finite irreducible subgroups of GL_5(Z). The 2 maximal groups are: 1) the wreath fifth power of the group of order 2, the automorphism group of Z^5, D5 and its dual, of order 3840; 2) the product of the symmetric group of degree 6 with the group of order 2, the automorphism group of the A5 lattice and its dual, with order 1440."
