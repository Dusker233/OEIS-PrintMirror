    "comment": [
        "The values up to 1169951 were computed by Joseph DeVincentis, Stan Wagon, and Al Zimmermann. The values appear to rise roughly quadratically, so the next one might be near 10^12 and impossible to find. It is known that the sequence is infinite: that is, the cost function is not bounded."

        "Example: a(4) = 23 because 23 can be reached by the path 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 23, which has 4 addition steps, and one can check that each smaller number has cost at most 3."
