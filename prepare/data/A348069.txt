        "Consider an integer complexity measure b(n) which is the number of ones required to build n using +, -, *, and /, where the latter operation is strict integer division, i.e., n/d is defined only when d|n. In other words, b(n) is defined identically to A091333(n) except that division is also allowed. Clearly for all n, b(n) <= A091333(n). This sequence lists the integers k for which b(k) < A091333(k).",
        "Both b(n) and A091333(n) are also often equal to A005245(n), the number of ones required to build n using just + and *.",
        "For the first 14 values of a, b(a(i)) = A091333(a(i)) - 1; it seems likely, however, that this difference will increase for larger values.",
        "Computing all n such that b(n) <= 64 reveals the following numbers that must appear in this sequence, with their b-values in brackets: 1011597943 [63], 1032855583 [63], 1035512789 [63], 1038141563 [64], 1040295757 [63], 1040295759 [63], 1162264748 [63], 1162264749 [63], 1183784827 [63], 1183784828 [63], 1183784829 [63], 1292730233 [64], 1370320619 [64], 1376697911 [64], 1377760793 [64], 1378292233 [64], 1379886557 [64], 1542507503 [64], 1556856409 [64], 1571205317 [64].  However, because the least n for which b(n) = 65 is A255641(65) = 913230103 < 1011597943, it's not necessarily the case that the next entry in a after 782015431 is 1011597943, although it's likely; and given the examples where the b-values decrease for successive terms of a, these listed numbers are quite likely not all consecutive terms of a."

Thus the first element of the sequence a is 50221174.",
