        "t(n) = psi(n) - n is the sum of aliquot divisors of n, d, such that n/d is squarefree. Penney & Pomerance proposed a problem to show that the \"pseudo-aliquot\" sequence related to this function is unbounded. This sequence lists number with pseudo-aliquot sequence of cycle 2. The sequence that is analogous to perfect numbers is A033845."
