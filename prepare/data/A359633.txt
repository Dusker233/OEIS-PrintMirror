        "Quadratic reciprocity says that for odd primes p and q, if p is a quadratic residue mod q then q is a quadratic residue mod p except in the case where p and q are both congruent to 3 (mod 4), in which case they can't both be quadratic residues mod each other.  Thus if a(n-1) == 1 (mod 4), a(n) is the least prime > a(n-1) that is a quadratic residue mod a(n-1), while if a(n-1) == 3 (mod 4), a(n) is the least prime > a(n-1) that is congruent to 1 (mod 4) and is a quadratic residue mod a(n-1)."
