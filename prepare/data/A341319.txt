        "Consider an n X n grid in which each cell represents a vote for a political party \"A\" or \"B\". The grid is divided into equal-sized districts and the winner of each district is decided by a majority of \"A\"s or \"B\"s. This sequence is the minimum number of \"A\"s needed to win more districts than \"B\" if n = 1, 2, 3, ... A tie within a district is not accepted. For example, if n=5, and the district size is also 5, party \"A\" needs 3 cells in 3 districts (total = 3*3=9) to win 3 districts to 2.",
