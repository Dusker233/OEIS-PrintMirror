        "The first nineteen terms are palindromes (cf. A002113). There are exactly seven different families of integers which together partition the terms of this sequence. See the file \"Sequences and families\" for more details, comments, formulas and examples.",

        "If w is a term with decimal representation a, then the number n corresponding to the string axa is also a term, where x is a string of k repeated digits 0 where k >= 0. The number n = w*10^(k+m)+w = w*(10^(k+m)+1) where m is the number of digits of w. Then R(n) = R(w)*10^(k+m)+R(w) = R(w)(10^(k+m)+1). Then n*R(n) = w*R(w)(10^(k+m)+1)^2 which is a square since w is a term.",
        "The same argument shows that numbers corresponding to axaxa, axaxaxa, ... are also terms.",
        "For example, since 528 is a term, so are 528528, 5280528, 52800528, 5280052800528, etc.",
