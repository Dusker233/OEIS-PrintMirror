        "We define a connectedness system (investigated by Vim van Dam in 2002) to be a set of finite nonempty sets (edges) that is closed under taking the union of any two overlapping edges. It is connected if it contains an edge containing all the vertices.",
        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every finite set of finite nonempty sets has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.",
