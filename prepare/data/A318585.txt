        "From _David A. Corneth_, Sep 03 2018: (Start)",
        "Let a valid tuple be a tuple of positive integers whose sum of reciprocals squared is an integer. Initially one only needs to consider tuples of positive integers where each element is > 1. After that some ones could be prepended to a valid tuple to find new valid tuples.",
        "One could define a prime tuple as a valid tuple where no proper part with elements is a valid tuple. So (1) would be a prime tuple as no proper part of (1) has elements and is a valid tuple. Other examples of prime tuples are (2, 2, 2, 2) and (2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6).",
        "The list of distinct elements in a tuple could be whittled down by finding for each positive integer m the least sum of a prime tuple in which that integer is. For each m, that sum is at most m^3. (End)"
