        "a(n) is the first member of the n-th sequence in the greedy partition of the nonnegative integers into sequences that contain no 3-term arithmetic progression.",
        "As a special case (proved by Roth in 1953) of Szemer\u00e9di's theorem, sequences with no 3-term arithmetic progressions must have density 0.  In particular, the nonnegative integers can't be partitioned into finitely many such sequences.  Therefore this sequence is infinite.",
        "a(n+1) >= a(n) + 2.  There seem to be many cases where this is an equality. (End)",
        "It can be deduced from the main result of Gerver, Propp, Simpson (below) that a(3n+1) = 3a(2n+1), a(3n+2) = 2 + 3a(2n+1), and a(3n) = 1 + 3a(2n). This implies infinitely many cases where a(n+1) = a(n) + 2. - _C. Kenneth Fan_, Dec 09 2018"
