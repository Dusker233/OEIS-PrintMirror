        "P. Freyd (see link) writes: \"Bower\u2019s sequence A050365 can be interpreted to count the number of anti-symmetric elhsls (and elhas), ... those for which all automorphisms are one.\" Here 'elha' stands for 'equationally linear Heyting algebra' and 'elhsl' means 'equationally linear Heyting semi-lattice'. Then Freyd gives another interpretation and coins the name Bower-rank. \"For a set of finite rank we may define its Bower-rank as the first ordinal larger than the product of the Bower-ranks of its elements. Then A050365 counts the number of sets of given Bower-rank.\" - _Peter Luschny_, Nov 13 2018"
