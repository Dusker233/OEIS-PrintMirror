        "Considering the uniform model of graph evolution [Flajolet] with 2n vertices initially isolated, the probability of the occurrence of an acyclic graph at time n is P(n) = a(n)/(2n)^(2n). See the following.",
        "Since endpoints of edges are in 1..2n, if at time n we write side by side the 2n endpoints of the included n edges, we can have any one of the (2n)^(2n) strings of length 2n in 2n characters [A085534]. A single forest G(V,E) corresponds to n! * 2^n sequences because the n edges of E(G) are exchanged for n! ways, and each permutation corresponds to 2^n sequences since each edge u-v can be in a sequence as u-v or v-u. So the number of distinct sequences of length 2n on 2n symbols formed by A302112(n) forests is a(n) = A302112(n) * n! * 2^n.",
        "If t < n, P(n) is a lower bound of P(t). If t > n, P(n) is an upper bound of P(t), P(t) the probability of an acyclic graph in time t.",
        "The expected value of the number of trials until the appearance of a forest at time n is ev(n) = 1/P(n) = (2*n)^(2*n) / a(n). Below is a table of n and corresponding values of ev(n) for selected values of n.",

Because the expected number of generated graphs is small when the number of nodes N = 2n we can use space proportional to 2n to store a graph. If n = 10^5, for example, from table above we expect to generate 11.79 graphs. For details about determination of bijections see [Havas]."
