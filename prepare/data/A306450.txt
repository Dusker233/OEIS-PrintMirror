        "Terms must be divisible by the square of a Mirimanoff prime p (or base-3 Wieferich prime, A014127) such that the multiplicative order of 3 modulo p is not divisible by 3. So far, the only known Mirimanoff primes are 11 and 1006003. The multiplicative order of 3 modulo 11 is 5, not a multiple of 3, while the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 1006003 is 1006002, which is a multiple of 3. As a result, all known terms are divisible by 3*11^2 = 363."
