        "Different from A344141, here you first check x^n + x + 1, x^n + x^2 + 1, ..., x^n + x^(n-1) + 1 until you get an irreducible polynomial over GF(2); if there are none, you then check x^n + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, x^n + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1, x^n + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1, x^n + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1, ..., x^n + x^(n-1) + x^(n-2) + x^(n-3) + 1 until you get an irreducible polynomial over GF(2). Once you find it, evaluate it at x = 2.",
        "Note that it is conjectured that an irreducible polynomial of degree n with 5 terms exists for every n. It follows from the conjecture that A000120(a(n)) = 3 for n in A073571 and 5 for n in A057486.",
        "In A057496 it is stated that if x^n + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible, then so is x^n + x^3 + 1. It follows that no term other than 19 can be of the form 2^n + 15."
