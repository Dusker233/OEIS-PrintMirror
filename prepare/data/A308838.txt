        "A field or ring is called \"Parker\" if no 3 X 3 magic square of 9 distinct squared elements can be formed. Conjecture: the sequence is complete.",
        "Example: the fact that p=31 is listed is taken to mean one cannot construct a 3 X 3 magic square of distinct squared elements of the finite field of order 31.",
        "Cain shows that each of the entries on the list corresponds to a Parker field and claims to have checked computationally that no other primes p < 1000 are on the list.",
        "Labruna shows at least there are infinitely many primes not on the list.",
