        "From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 30 2019: (Start)",
        "Quoting from p. 59 in Cyvin et al. (1997): \"When an octagon is rooted at an edge ... then either (a) one branch can be attached in five directions at a time, (b) two branches can be attached in six ways, or (c) three branches in one way. Let the numbers of these kinds of systems be denoted by (a) U_r^*, (b) U_r^{**}, and (c) U_r^{***}, respectively.\"",
        "Here r is \"the number of octagons or eight-membered rings\" in an edge-rooted catapolygon (here, catapolyoctagon). A catapolyoctagon is a \"catacondensed polygonal system consisting of octagons\" (where \"catacondensed\" means it has no internal vertices).",
        "On p. 59 in Cyvin et al. (1997), the total number of edge-rooted catapolyoctagons (each with r octagons) is denoted by U_r, and we have U_r = U_r^* + U_r^{**} + U_r^{***} for r >= 2.",
        "We have U_r = A036758(r), U_r^* = A121112(r), U_r^{**} = A121113(r), and U_r^{***} = a(r) (current sequence) for r >= 1.",
        "For the current sequence, we have a(r) = U_r^{***} = Sum_{i = 1..r-3} U(i) * Sum_{j = 1..r-i-2} U(j) * U(r-1-i-j) for r >= 4, where U(r) = A036758(r), with a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = 0. See Eq. (13) on p. 59 in Cyvin et al. (1997).",
        "The ultimate purpose of these calculations (in the paper by Cyvin et al. (1997)) is the calculation of I_r = A036760(r), which is the \"number of nonisomorphic free (unrooted) catapolyoctagons when r is given.\" These catapolyoctagons \"represent a class of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons, C_{6r+2} H_{4r+4}\" (see p. 57 in Cyvin et al. (1997)).",
        "The g.f.'s of the sequences U, U^*, U^{**}, and U^{***} appear also in Eqs. (2) and (3) on p. 194 in Brunvoll et al. (1997).",
