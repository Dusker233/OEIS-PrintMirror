        "This sequence starts at a(0)=1, subsequent terms a(n) for n>0 being obtained by selecting the (greatest Ulam number) <= 1+Sum_{i=0..n-1} a(i). This ensures that the sequence is complete because Sum_{i=0..n-1} a(i) >= a(n)-1, for all n>=0 and a(0)=1, is a necessary and sufficient condition for completeness."
