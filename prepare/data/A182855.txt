The first member of this sequence that does not fit that description is 75675600, whose prime signature is (4,3,2,2,1,1).",
        "A full characterization is: Numbers whose prime signature (1) has not all equal multiplicities but (2) the numbers of distinct parts appearing with each distinct multiplicity are all equal. For example, the prime signature of 2520 is {1,1,2,3}, which satisfies (1) but fails (2), as the numbers of distinct parts appearing with each distinct multiplicity are 1 (with multiplicity 2, the part being 1) and 2 (with multiplicity 1, the parts being 2 and 3). Hence the sequence does not contain 2520. - _Gus Wiseman_, Jan 02 2019"
