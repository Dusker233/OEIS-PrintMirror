        "A set is factorable if it is the union of at least two disjoint translated copies of a subset of at least two elements. E.g. the subset *..*.**..***.*.* of the 1x16 grid (where * denotes gridpoints in the selected subset and . denotes the remaining unselected gridpoints) is factorable into 3 copies of the 3-element subset *..*.*, as shown by displaying the factors by 1..1.12..232.3.3, where the numerals denote the elements of a particular translated copy."
