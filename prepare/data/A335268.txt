        "Since the unitary divisors of a power of prime (A000961), p^e, are {1, p^e}, they are trivial terms and hence they are excluded from this sequence.",

        "The squarefree terms of A335267 are also terms of this sequence.",
        "The terms with 2 distinct prime divisors are of the form p^e * (2*p^e - 1), when the second factor is also a prime power. The least term which both of its 2 prime divisors are nonunitary (with multiplicity larger than 1) is 1225 = 5^2 * 7^2 = 5^2 * (2 * 5^2 - 1).",
