        "It appears that primes of this form are much less common than primes of the form m^k-k (A099228).",
        "As N increases, squares <= N outnumber all higher powers <= N by an increasingly wide margin, so the above observation is increasingly a consequence of the fact that primes of the form m^2 + 2 are less common than primes of the form m^2 - 2. Among numbers of these two forms, multiples of 3 make up 2/3 of the former, but none of the latter. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jun 05 2021"
