        "If p = 2^(1+t) + (1+2*t)*k - 1 is a prime, for some t > 0 and k even, then x = 2^t*p is in the sequence where k is the value by which the sum of aliquot parts is increased.",
        "In this sequence k = -4; for t = 20 we get 2198850240512, which is a term greater than 149775190016, but this does not exclude the existence of other intermediate terms following a different solution pattern.",
        "In fact, there could be also sporadic solutions of the type x = 2^t*r*q, where r and q are prime and for which no closed form is known. E.g. for k = -4 we have x = 2^31*4294967357*297528134446815421.",
        "To find them, since d(n) = 4*(t+1) and sigma(n) = (2^(t+1)-1)*(1+r)*(1+q), the relation 2*n = sigma(n) + k*(d(n)-1) becomes 2^(t+1)*r*q = (2^(t+1)-1)*(1+r)*(1+q) + k*(4*t+3), which, for fixed t and k, is a quadratic Diophantine equation in r and q that could admit solutions with r and q prime.",
        "(End)",
        "Terms using odd values of k seem very hard to find. Up to n = 10^12, only three such terms are known: 2, 98, and 8450, for k = 1, 5, and -7, respectively."
