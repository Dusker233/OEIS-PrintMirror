        "a(n) is also the number of partitions of 2n with two kinds of parts where all parts of the second kind are even. E.g., the a(2) = 9 such partitions are (2', 2'), (4'), (2,2'), (4), (1,1,2'), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1). A bijection is to take each component in the graph whose edges are the union of two n-edge matchings, map each path of length p to a part p and each cycle (which must be even) of length p to a part p'."
