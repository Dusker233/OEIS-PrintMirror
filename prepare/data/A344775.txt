        "A 2-balanced partition is a partition of a set which is the union of three subsets, with the property that the cardinality of the first two subsets are equal (possibly zero), and each block contains the same number (possibly zero) of elements from the first and from the second subset.",
        "a(n) is calculated as the sum of the numbers b(n,k) (A343254) of 2-balanced partitions of a set of n elements in which the first and the second subsets have cardinality k. The sum runs over all integers k from zero to floor(n/2)."

There are only two 2-balanced partitions: {{p,q},{r}}, and {{p,q,r}}. So, b(3,1)=2 and a(3)=7."
