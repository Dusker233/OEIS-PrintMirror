        "Every sequence can be uniquely split into a sequence of non-overlapping runs. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are ((2,2),(1,1,1),(3),(2,2)), with sums (4,3,3,4). The run-sum trajectory is obtained by repeatedly taking the run-sum transformation (A353847) until the rank of an anti-run is reached. For example, the trajectory 11 -> 10 -> 8 corresponds to the trajectory (2,1,1) -> (2,2) -> (4).",
        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions."
