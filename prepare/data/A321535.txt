        "Consider a grasshopper (cf. A141000, A141002) that starts at x=0 at time 0, then makes successive hops of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., n, subject to the constraints that it must always land on a point x >= 0 and no point may be visited more than once; sequence gives number of different ways that it can make n hops.",
