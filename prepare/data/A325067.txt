        "Kaplansky showed that prime numbers congruent to 1 modulo 16 are representable by both or neither of the quadratic forms x^2 + 32*y^2 and x^2 + 64*y^2. This sequence corresponds to those representable by both, and A325068 corresponds to those representable by neither.",
        "Also, Kaplansky showed that prime numbers congruent to 9 modulo 16 are representable by exactly one of these quadratic forms. A325069 corresponds to those representable by the first form and A325070 to those representable by the second form.",
