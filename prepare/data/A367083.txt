        "The sequence mostly alternates between powers of 3 (odd terms) and powers of 4 (even terms), but after either 3 or 4 powers of 4, separated by powers of 3, there occur two consecutive powers of 3 in a row.",
        "Sequence A367084 lists the indices n of odd terms immediately followed by another odd term. We can split the sequence of terms > 1 in groups of 7 or 9 consecutive terms (a(A367084(n)+1 .. A367084(n+1)) such that each group starts and ends with an odd term. The sequence of the group lengths will be 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, etc. There will always be 4 or 5 consecutive 9's separated by a single 7. The run lengths of the 9's are (4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, ...) but this pattern is also slightly irregular, with two consecutive 5's occurring after every 24 (very rarely fewer) elements.",
