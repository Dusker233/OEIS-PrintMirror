        "a(n) is the number of free polyominoes that have both width and height <= n. Compare this to _Craig Knecht_'s A268311 which has both height and width = n. The word \"aligned\" in the title refers to the restriction that the polyominoes have edges parallel to the sides of the square, in contrast with A268427."
