        "For n=1, let the ordered sequence of integers be S = (s_1). The maximum value of the Gilbreath equation of S is k = s_1 + 1. Rewriting this as a function of s_1 gives s_1 + 1, which can take only 1 value, so a(1)=1.",
        "For n=2, let the ordered sequence of integers be S = (s_1, s_2). The maximum value of the Gilbreath equation of S is k = s_1^1 + s2 + 1. Rewriting this as a function of s_1, s_2 gives 1 - s_1 + 2*s_2, which can take only 1 value, so a(2)=1.",
