        "To prove this, note that the group Aut(G) = Co_0 acts transitively on each of the sets L(2), L(3), L(4), L(5), and L(7) (cf. A323273). It easy to find one representative from each set L(3), L(4), L(5) among the sums of pairs of minimal vectors. There are two orbits on L(6) and again it is easy to find a representative from each orbit, for example",
