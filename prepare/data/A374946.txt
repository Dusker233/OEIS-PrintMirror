        "A Legendrian n-mosaic is an n X n array of the 10 tiles given in Figure 5 of Pezzimenti and Pandey. These tiles represent part of a Legendrian curve in the front projection. A Legendrian n-mosaic is suitably connected if the connection points of each tile coincide with those of the contiguous tiles."
