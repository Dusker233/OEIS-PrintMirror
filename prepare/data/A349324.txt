        "Numbers z such that there are exactly 6 solutions to z^2 = x^2 + y^4 with x, y, z positive integers.",

        "Note that y^4 = z^2 - x^2 = (z - x)*(z + x), so each solution corresponds to a positive integer y and a factorization of y^4 into two positive integers f = z - x and g = z + x. We need f < g so that x > 0, and we need f == g (mod 2) so that (f + g)/2 = (z - x + z - x)/2 = z will be an integer.",
        "Note also that it follows from y^4 = z^2 - x^2 that y < sqrt(z).",
        "Thus, given some value zMax, we can generate the value of z for each solution to z^2 = x^2 + y^4 over the positive integers with z <= zMax by simply computing z = (f + y^4/f)/2 for (1) every divisor f (< y^2) of y^4 for each odd y < sqrt(zMax) and (2) every even divisor f (< y^2) of y^4 such that y^4/f is also even for each even y < sqrt(zMax), and discarding those results that exceed zMax. For any given y, the smaller the value of f, the larger the resulting z. So, for each y, we can test the divisors of y^4 that are less than y^2 in descending order, and move on to the next value of y as soon as we either exhaust all the allowed divisors or get a value of z that exceeds zMax.",
