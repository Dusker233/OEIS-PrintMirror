        "a(n) is the weighted average of the first 2n - 1 primes, using row 2n - 2 of Pascal's triangle as weights, with the result rounded down. a(n) is thus based on the longest ordered list of consecutive primes that has prime(n) in the central position, while giving substantially greater weight to the primes near prime(n).",
        "A guiding aim when framing the definition was having the arithmetic mean of the first k terms close to the arithmetic mean of the first k primes. In this respect, a simplified analysis suggested the binomial weighting might perform equally well for large k as small k, and empirical results were encouraging. For all k <= 500 the difference between the means is < 0.541, with 0.5 being exceeded only for 394 <= k <= 401. (These figures become not quite as good if floor rounding is replaced by nearest-integer, though a rounding midway between the two does better than either.)",
