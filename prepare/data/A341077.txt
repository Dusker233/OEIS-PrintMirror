        "For D=13, the least positive y for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution is 2. The next primes, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution are 19, 31, and 43, but the smallest positive y in each of those cases is 1 or 2, neither of which is larger than the previous record y, 2. So 19, 31, and 43 are not terms of this sequence.",
        "The next prime, D, after 43 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -3 has a solution is 61, and the least positive y for which it has a solution is y=722, which is larger than 2, so it is a new record y value. So 61 is a term of this sequence and 722 is the corresponding term of A341078."
