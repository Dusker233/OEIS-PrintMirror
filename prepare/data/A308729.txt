        "This is a special case (k=2) of a general (n,k)-team-hiring-problem, which is an extension to the assistant-hiring problem in Section 5.1 of the textbook Introduction to Algorithms by T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest, and C. Stein.",

        "For n=4, the lexical ordering of all the 2-subsets of [4] is 12,13,14,23,24,34. If we choose the order of ranks to be 12<13<14<23<24<34, then under the permutation 2314, the sequence of 2-subsets becomes 23,12,13,24,34,14, in which there are 3 left-to-right maxima 23,24,and 34. Summarizing over all permutations of [4], we can obtain that the total number of left-to-right maxima is 61, which is the largest over all possible orders of ranks on these 6 2-sebsets."
