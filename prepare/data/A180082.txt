        "As stated in A217843, any number that is the sum of consecutive nonnegative cubes can also be expressed as the product of two integers whose sum and difference are both promic. (Therefore, it cannot be prime.) It can also be expressed as the difference of the squares of two triangular numbers (A000217); thus, the two primes that are the factors of any term of this sequence are respectively the sum and difference of two triangular numbers.
