        "A k-composition of n is an ordered collection of k positive integers (parts) which sum to n. A k-composition is aperiodic (primitive) if its period is k, i.e., if it is not the concatenation of at least two smaller compositions. A palindrome is a word which is the same when written backwards.",
        "A k-double-palindrome of n is a k-composition of n which is the concatenation of two palindromes, PP'=P|P', where both |P|, |P'|>=1. For example 1123532=11|23532 is a 7-double-palindrome of 17 since both 11 and 23532 are palindromes. It is also aperiodic, so it is an aperiodic 7-double-palindrome of 17. See sequence A181111.",
