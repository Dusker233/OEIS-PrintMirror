        "A possible exception are powers of 16. It can be proved that 16^(5^(k-1) + floor((k+3)/4)) == 16^floor((k+3)/4) (mod 10^k) (see attached proof). Thus it may be that there is a power of 16 that does not contain any of the digits 1, 2, 4, and 8 or the number 65536 as a substring. - _Bassam Abdul-Baki_, Apr 10 2019"
