    "comment": [
        "a(n) is also the number of subspaces of R^n given by coordinate equalities of the form x_i = x_j, x_i = -x_j and x_i = 0, that are orthogonal to the vector of all 1's.",

    "example": [
        "The set {1,2} has the trivial partition consisting only of the class {1,2}, together with the involution that sends {1,2} to itself. There is also the singleton partition with classes {1} and {2}, together with the involution that maps {1} to {2} and vice versa. The other involution on the two classes {1} and {2} has two fixed points and is therefore not counted, Hence, we find a(2) = 2.",
        "Alternatively, in R^2 we have two subspaces given by coordinate equalities of the form x_i = x_j, x_i = -x_j and x_i = 0, that are orthogonal to the vector (1,1). These are the zero-space and the subspace given by x_1 = -x_2. In R^3 we find the zero-space and the three subspaces given by x_i = -x_j, x_k = 0 for {i,j,k} = {1,2,3}. This shows that a(3) = 4."
