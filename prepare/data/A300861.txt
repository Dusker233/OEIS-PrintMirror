        "Consider numbers in the cototient of n, listed in row n of A121998. For composite n > 4, there are nondivisors m in the cototient, listed in row n of A133995. Of these m, there are two species. The first are m that divide n^e with integer e > 1, while the last do not divide n^e. These are listed in row n of A272618 and A272619, and counted by A243822(n) and A243823(n), respectively. This sequence lists the records in A300858, which is a function that represents the difference between the latter and the former species of nondivisors in the cototient of n."

(All prime powers m have A243822(m) = 0 and for m > 4, A243823(m) is positive.) Therefore 1 is the next term. Between 8 and 15, -1 <= A300858(n) <= 1.",
