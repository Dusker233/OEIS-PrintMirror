        "In an integer partition, two primes are equivalent if each part has in its prime factorization the same multiplicity of both primes. For example, in (6,5) the primes {2,3} are equivalent while {2,5} and {3,5} are not. In (30,6) also, the primes {2,3} are equivalent, while {2,5} and {3,5} are not.",
        "Also MM-numbers of T_0 multiset multisystems. A multiset multisystem is a finite multiset of finite multisets. The multiset multisystem with MM-number n is formed by taking the multiset of prime indices of each part of the multiset of prime indices of n. For example, the prime indices of 78 are {1,2,6}, so the multiset multisystem with MM-number 78 is {{},{1},{1,2}}. The dual of a multiset multisystem has, for each vertex, one block consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}. The T_0 condition means the dual is strict (no repeated parts)."
