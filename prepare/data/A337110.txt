        "Let (a, b, n) be such a tuple. Let without loss of generality b be the geometric mean of the tuple. Then a*b*n = b^3 and as b is not 0 we have b^2 = a*n. So then b^2 == 0 (mod n). If b^2 == 0 (mod n) has only 1 solution then b = n. This gives the tuple (n, n, n) which has 1 permutation. So giving a(n) = a(n-1) + 1. (End)"
