        "Paul Lescot observed that if m is a perfect number and 2m - 1 is prime, then m * (2m - 1) belongs to this sequence.",
        "Moreover, Lescot proved that an even integer k belongs to this sequences if and only if k = m * (2m - 1) for an even perfect number m = 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1) and 2m - 1 is prime. Among all primes p in A000043 (Mersenne exponents) up to 23209, only p = 2 and 5, which give 66 and 491536 respectively, satisfy this condition.",
        "An even term k in this sequence belongs to A256151 since k = m * (2m - 1) and sigma(k) is square.",
        "Lescot also confirms that there exists no odd integer between 5 and 10^6 in this sequence and conjectures that there exists no further odd term in this sequence.",
        "There exists no further term in this sequence in n <= 2^32.",
        "Question: are there only four terms in this sequence?"
