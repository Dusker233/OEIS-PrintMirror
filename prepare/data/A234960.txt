    "comment": [
        "The rules generate successive generations g(n) as follows:  g(1) = (2), which begets 3 and 5, so that g(2) = (3,5); then g(3) = (7,11); g(4) = (13,17,19,23); etc.  The number of primes in g(n) is given by A234961, and primes not generated, beginning with 71, are given by A234962.  Conjecture:  the limiting relative density of generated primes is 0."
