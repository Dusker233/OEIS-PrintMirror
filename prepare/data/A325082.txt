        "Brink showed that prime numbers congruent to 4, 9, 14, 34 or 49 modulo 55 are representable by exactly one of the quadratic forms x^2 + x*y + 14*y^2 or x^2 + x*y + 69*y^2. A325081 corresponds to those representable by the first form, and this sequence corresponds to those representable by the second form."
