    "comment": [
        "This sequence is different from A030077 because there we only look at how many different total path lengths occur, whereas here we look at which individual segment lengths occur in the path. The latter count may be larger, because it can happen that two paths whose compositions are distinct can have the same total length. For n <= 16 this happens just when n is 12 and 15.",
        "Say the type of a segment is its position in the increasing list of floor(n/2) possible segment lengths. The Buratti-Horak-Rosa conjecture is that the following condition is necessary and sufficient for a multiset to be realizable as a path: for each divisor d of n, the number of segments of type divisible by d is at most n-d. The sequence confirms the conjecture up to n=37. - _Brendan McKay_, May 14 2022",
        "If the Buratti-Horak-Rosa conjecture is true, the values of a(38)-a(50) are 144079707346575, 212327989773900, 947309492837400, 1397281501935165, 6236646703759395, 9206478467454345, 41107996877935680, 60727722660586800, 271250494550621040, 400978991944396320, 1791608261879217600, 2650087220696342700, 11844267374132633700. - _Brendan McKay_, Jun 14 2022"
