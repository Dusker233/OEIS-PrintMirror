        "It seems that the fraction of prime gaps g, satisfying g == 0 (mod 6), tends to a constant, say c, when the number of prime gaps tends to infinity. From n = 43 we obtain that c > 0.463, while it can be argued heuristically that c < 0.5.",
        "Meanwhile, the fractions of prime gaps g, satisfying either g == 2 (mod 6) or g == 4 (mod 6), seem to tend both to another constant, (1-c)/2, when the number of prime gaps tends to infinity (see A341531 and A341532)."
