        "This is a subset of sequence A351396, and adds the extra condition that d is included only if it is the smallest value of d with a given repetend; thus duplicate repetends are not permitted. This eliminates some values of A351396 which are powers of 10 of d. For example, 1480 is excluded because although its period (k=3 based on a repetend of 675) divides evenly into 1479, this repetend already exists for a smaller value of d, namely 148, and 3 also divides evenly into 147. 1480 is the smallest such value of d from A351396 that will be excluded based on this modification. Other values of A351396 that are excluded include 3700, 5920, 9250, 14800, ..."
