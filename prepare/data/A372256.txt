        "Consider a five-card trick, where the assistant gets four cards from a deck and is told which card to hide. Moreover, the deck has a duplicate of each card. In the worst case scenario, the assistant gets two duplicates and has to hide the other card. There are six different ways to arrange two pairs of cards. Thus, the assistant can signal a number 1 through 6. The hidden card can't take a value of the cards on the table, so the maximum number of distinct values is 8. Thus a(5) = 8."
