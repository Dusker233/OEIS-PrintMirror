        "The cutting number of a node v in a graph G is the number of pairs of nodes {u,w} of G such that u!=v, w!=v, and every path from u to w contains v. The cutting number of a connected graph (including trees as considered here), is the maximum cutting number of any node in the graph. The cutting center of a graph is the set of nodes with cutting number equal to the cutting number of the graph. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jan 16 2020"
