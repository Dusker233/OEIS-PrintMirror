        "Take a number. Write this number in capital letters. Remove any spaces or hyphens to form a single block of contiguous letters. Cut this block into two parts using a vertical line which is tangent to at least one of the letters. The word ONE, for example, admits four cuts, the first before the O, the second between the O and the N, the third between the N and the E, the fourth after the E. These respective cuts produce the four pairs of subsets of following letters: \u2014/ONE, O/NE, ON/E, ONE/\u2014. A weight is now assigned to each subset. To do this, we replace each letter in the subset by its rank in the alphabet. Then we add up these ranks within the subset. The weights of the four successive pairs above are therefore {0;34}, {15;19}, {29;5}, {34;0}. The absolute difference of the two numbers that form such a pair is called imbalance. The successive imbalances in the example here are 34, 4, 24 and 34."
