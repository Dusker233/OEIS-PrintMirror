I would introduce the arithmetic-arithmetic sequence which is defined as the sequence of finite differences, that is, with k consecutive rows of differences, whose first terms are d(1), d(2), d(3),..., d(k), the last row (k-th row) being of a constant difference. Here, it is submitted a special case of the above mentioned sequence with k=3, d(0)=d(1)=1,  d(2)=2, d(3)=3.",
