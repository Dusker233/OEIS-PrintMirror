        "An order n triangle contains binomial(n,2) upright 2 X 2 subtriangles and binomial(n-2,2) inverted 2 X 2 subtriangles. In total, there are n^2-3*n+3 subtriangles.",
        "It seems that the sequence is likely finite. Considering each of the n^2! possibilities of arranging 1..n^2, for each of the (n^2-3n+3) subtriangles only one choice for the central value can give the magic sum. We should, therefore, divide (n^2)! by (n^2)^(n^2-3*n+3) to calculate an estimation of a(n). For n >= 16, (n^2)!/(n^2)^(n^2-3*n+3) < 1.",
        "For n >= 3, a(n) is a multiple of 8, because swapping between a corner triangle and an edge-adjacent triangle generate different examples,",
        "Disregarding corner swap, a(3) to a(6) would be \"18, 4792, 67488, 10906128\""
