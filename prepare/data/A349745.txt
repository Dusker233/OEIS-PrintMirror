Incidentally, the first six known terms of A005820 satisfy this condition, while on the other hand, any hypothetical odd 3-perfect number would be excluded from this sequence. Also, as a corollary, any hypothetical 3-perfect numbers of the form 4u+2 must not be multiples of 3 if they are to appear here. Similarly for any k which occurs in A349169, for 2*k to occur in this sequence, it shouldn't be a multiple of 3 and k should also be a term of A191218.
