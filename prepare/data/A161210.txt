        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n rounds. A161211 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.",
        "This structure is a three-dimensional version of the toothpick structure of A153006.",
        "Toothpicks are placed following a rotation of axes: x,y,z,x,y,z,... and so on.",
