    "comment": [
        "According to their ambiguous principal ideals (API), the normal closures of pure cubic number fields can be classified into three types (see Aouissi et al.). For each type, the generating radicals (cube roots) are API. For type Alpha, relative API exist additionally. For type Beta, absolute API exist additionally. For type Gamma, only the radicals are API, but some unit of the normal closure has a primitive third root of unity as its cyclic cubic relative norm. The latter property is characteristic for type Gamma. If the radicand is a prime p == 1 (mod 9) then type Beta is excluded, and, statistically, type Alpha dominates by far. The present subsequence of radicands with type Gamma is very sparse. Ismaili and El Mesaoudi have proved an important application of this subsequence. Type Gamma enables more capitulation types of closely related normal closures in their unramified cyclic cubic extensions than type Alpha."
