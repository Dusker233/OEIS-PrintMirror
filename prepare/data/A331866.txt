        "The corresponding primes are a subset of the near-repunit primes A105992 (at least when they have k > 2 digits).",
        "In base 10, R(k) + 3*10^floor(k/2) has k digits all of which are 1 except for one digit 4 (for k > 0) located in the center (for odd k) or just to the left of it (for even k): i.e., there are ceiling(k/2)-1 digits 1 to the left and floor(k/2) digits 1 to the right of the digit 4. For odd k, this is a palindrome a.k.a. wing prime, cf. A077780, the subsequence of odd terms.",
        "a(14) = 19378 was found by _Amiram Eldar_, verified to be the 14th term in collaboration with the author of the sequence and factordb.com. The term a(13) = 3089 corresponds to a certified prime (Ivan Panchenko, 2011, cf. factordb.com); a(12) and a(14) are only PRP as far as we know."
