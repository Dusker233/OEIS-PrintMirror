    "name": "Number of non-isomorphic multiset partitions of weight n in which both the multiset union of the parts and the multiset union of the dual parts are aperiodic.",
    "comment": [
        "The latter condition is equivalent to the parts having relatively prime sizes.",
        "A multiset is aperiodic if its multiplicities are relatively prime.",
        "The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.",
        "The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices."
