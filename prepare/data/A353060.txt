        "On an n X n square board we draw a path with squares that we number 1, 2, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., n, 1, ... of the greatest length, which will be a(n). The path advances from one number to the next with a knight move; after n it goes back to number 1. There cannot be repeated numbers in the same row or column."
