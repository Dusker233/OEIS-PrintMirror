        "Conjecture: Except the first term a(1) = 3, all the other terms do not end with 3.",
        "It is easy to prove that the numbers A317298(n) end with 3 only when n ends with 1. In this case A317298(10*n+1) = (10*n + 1)*(20*n + 3), which is composite for n > 0. Therefore the conjecture is true. - _Bruno Berselli_, Feb 11 2019",
        "Essentially (apart from the 3) the same as A188382, because for even n, A317298(n=2k) has the form 1+2*k+8*k^2 and for odd n A317298(n) is a multiple of n and not prime. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 14 2019"
