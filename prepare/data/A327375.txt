        "A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges. The vertex-connectivity of a set-system is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed (along with any resulting empty edges) to obtain a non-connected set-system or singleton. Note that this means a single node has vertex-connectivity 0."
