        "Also, hypotenuses c of Pythagorean triangles with legs a and b such that a and b are also the hypotenuses of Pythagorean triangles, where the Pythagorean triples (x1,y1,a) and (x2,y2,b) are similar triangles, but the Pythagorean triples (a,b,c) and (x1,y1,a) are not similar. For example, 65^2 = 25^2 + 60^2 with 25^2 = 15^2 +  20^2 and 60^2 = 36^2 + 48^2 with the two smaller triangles being similar. - _Naohiro Nomoto_"
