        "The primes to insert are: 2 (after the first digit), 3 (after the second digit, if there are at least three), etc.",
        "Inspired by A304243 and analog sequences given in cross-references.",
        "The sequence is finite: if insertion of 3 after the second digit yields a prime, then the sum of digits must be congruent to 1 or 2 (mod 3). However, insertion of 2 after the first digit also must yield a prime, so only the second case is possible. But then, insertion of a digit 7 cannot yield a prime, so no term can have 5 digits or more. (Sequence A304243 circumvents this restriction by excluding 3 from the primes to insert, but it is still finite for a similar reason occurring later.)"
