        "From 7 on, sequence gives primes + two. This can be easily seen since the definition is equivalent to the following: \"Numbers m such that there's only one k, 2 <= k <= m-2, that divides m-2.\" So k|(m-2) and values of k: m and m-1 are not considered since they don't divide m-2. But this 2nd statement is also the same as saying that m-2 is a prime number and so m = prime + 2.",
