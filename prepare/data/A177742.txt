        "A simple counting argument shows that no 2-regular graph of even order possesses a strong VMTL.",
        "In 2-regular graphs we can swap the interpretation of edges and vertices; so this sequence also gives the number of super edge magic total labelings; hence c.f. the (n,n) diagonal of A060408."
