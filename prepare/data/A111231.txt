        "A sum of m distinct primes is >= A007504(m) ~ m^2(log m)/2 > m^2, also for small m, therefore the second condition excludes squares m^2. On the other hand, considering results related to Goldbach's conjecture (e.g., every even number >= 4 is the sum of at most 4 primes), it is increasingly improbable that some m^k with k >= 3 is not the sum of m primes. This explains the first comment - but can it be rigorously proved? - _M. F. Hasler_, May 25 2018"
