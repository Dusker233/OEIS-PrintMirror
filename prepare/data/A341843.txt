        "For each n from 9 through 48, the most frequently occurring difference between consecutive primes is 6. On p. 108 of the article by Odlyzko et al., the authors estimate that around n=117, the jumping champion (i.e., the most frequently occurring difference between consecutive primes) becomes 30, and around n=1412 it becomes 210. Successive jumping champions are conjecturaly the primorial numbers A002110.",
