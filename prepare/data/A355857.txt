    "comment": [
        "The sequence starts at n = 5 as there are no numbers whose binary value shares n out of n+1 bits with their binary divisor concatenations for n <= 4. In general each term is twice or very close to twice the previous term, although this does not hold true for a(4) to a(5), implying other terms which are significantly lower than twice the previous term may also exist.",
