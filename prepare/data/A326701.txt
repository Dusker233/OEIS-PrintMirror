        "A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, and {{2},{1,3}} is a set partition, it follows that 18 belongs to the sequence."
