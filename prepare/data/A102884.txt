        "Many of these are excluded because the sum of a(n)*6 and its divisors less than or equal to its square root is prime, but not always. a(3) = 18. 18*6 = 108. Adding the divisors less than or equal to the square root of 108 yields 133. 133 is not prime, but shares no common divisor with 108 greater than 1."
