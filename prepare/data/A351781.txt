        "a(n) is the number of women's ranking tables in the stable marriage problem that can be paired with a men's ranking table having no two men with the same first choice, without forming any mutual first choices. It has two terms: (n-1)^n from A065440(n), and (n-1)!^n from A091868(n-1). Such men's ranking tables having no two men with the same first choice arise in A343694, A343475, and A344663.",
        "a(n)*A123234 is a useful alternative to A343696 which combines a Latin men's ranking table with an arbitrary women's table, since it gives fewer instances to consider."
