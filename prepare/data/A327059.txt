    "comment": [
        "A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets. Its elements are sometimes called edges. The dual of a set-system has, for each vertex, one edge consisting of the indices (or positions) of the edges containing that vertex. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,3}} is {{1},{1,2},{2}}. A weak antichain is a multiset of sets, none of which is a proper subset of any other."
