        "The above conjecture is true.",
        "Proof: The cases of 0, 1, 4 can be checked by inspection. Next we show that if n is prime and not equal to 3, then n is a term. Let n be prime and consider a palindromic normal partition of n covering the integers 1,...,k with k > 1. Then the multiplicity of 1 and k are the same and the multiplicities of 2 and k-1 are the same, etc.",
        "If k is even, then n is of the form (k+1)r. Since n is prime, this implies that n = k+1. Since n >= k(k+1)/2. this means that k = 2 and n = 3.",
        "If k is odd, then n is of the form (k+1)r + w(k+1)/2. Let m = (k+1)/2, then n = m(2r+w). Since n is prime and r,w > 0, this means that m = 1, k = 1, a contradiction.",
        "Next we show that if n is composite and not equal to 4, then n is not a term.",
        "Suppose n = pq for 1 < p <= q. If p is odd, let k = p-1 > 1.",
        "Consider the partition covering 1,..,k where the multiplicity is 1 except for 1 and k where the multiplicity is q-k/2 + 1 > 0. This is a normal palindromic partition summing up to pq = n.",
        "If p is even, without loss of generality we can choose p = 2. Since n != 4, q >= 3. In this case, choosing k = 3 with 1 and 3 having multiplicity 1 and 2 having multiplicity q-2 > 0 results in a normal palindromic partition of 2q = n. QED",

The normal integer partitions of 7 are (3211), (2221), (22111), (211111), (1111111), none of which has palindromic multiplicities except the last, so 7 belongs to the sequence."
