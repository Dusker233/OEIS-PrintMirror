        "Since the summand (part) which divides all the other summands is necessarily the smallest, an equivalent definition is: \"Number of partitions of n such that smallest part divides every part.\" - _Joerg Arndt_, Jun 08 2009",
        "The first few partitions that fail the criterion are 5=3+2, 7=5+2=4+3=3+2+2. So a(5) = A000041(5) - 1 = 6, a(7) = A000041(7) - 3 = 12. - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Jun 17 2003",
