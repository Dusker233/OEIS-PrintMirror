        "There were errors in the definition (in the order and structure of the group). The rational form of the Molien series was correct, but the DATA section - the coefficients in the expansion of the Molien series - was wrong from the 28th term onwards. To make it easier to check I have replaced the formulas with Maple code based on the Latex source code for the book. Thanks to _Georg Fischer_ and _Andrey Zabolotskiy_ for noticing that something was wrong and proposing corrections. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 29 2021"
