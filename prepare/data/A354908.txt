        "The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.",
        "If a collapse is an adding together of some partial run of an integer composition c, we say c is collapsible iff by some sequence of collapses it can be reduced to a single part. An example of such a sequence of collapses is (11132112) -> (332112) -> (33222) -> (6222) -> (66) -> (n), which shows that (11132112) is a collapsible composition of 12."
