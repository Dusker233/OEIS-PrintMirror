        "In 1996, Kenichiro Kashihara conjectured that there is no prime power of an integer (A093771) belonging to this sequence (disregarding the trivial case 1); a direct search from 12 to a(100128) has confirmed the conjecture up to 10^1035. There are no perfect powers among terms t which are permutations of 123_...(m - 1)_m for m == {2, 3, 5, 6} (mod 9). This is since 10 == 1 (mod 9) and also (1 + 0) == 1 (mod 9), so digit position has no effect. Hence, t == A134804(m) (mod 9). Now, if m is such that A134804(m) = {3, 6}, there is a lone factor of 3, which is not a perfect power (indeed).",
