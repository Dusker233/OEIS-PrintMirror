    "comment": [
        "k is in the sequence if the number of divisors of the central binomial coefficient C(k, floor(k/2)) (i.e., C(k, k/2) for even k, and C(k,(k-1)/2) = C(k,(k+1)/2) for odd k) is greater than the number of divisors of C(k, j) for all other values of j."

    "example": [
        "If n=10 and k=0..10 then A000005(binomial(10,k)) = 1, 4, 6, 16, 16, 18, 16, 16, 6, 4, 1. The maximum value of A000005(binomial(10,k)), i.e., 18 occurs only at k=5, the central coefficient. Thus 10 is in this sequence."
