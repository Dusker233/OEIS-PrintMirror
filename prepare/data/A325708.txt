        "The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k), so these are Heinz numbers of integer partitions covering an initial interval of positive integers and containing all of their distinct multiplicities. The enumeration of these partitions by sum is given by A325707."
