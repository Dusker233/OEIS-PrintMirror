        "A special case of a bound on d(n) by Erd\u0151s and Suranyi (1960) was used to get a limit: a = x/d(x) > 0.5*sqrt(x) and below 4194304 a computer test shows these values did not occur as x = a*d(x). For larger x this is impossible since if d(x) < sqrt(x), then x/d(x) > sqrt(4194304) = 2048 > the given terms.",
