        "For D=29, the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 16. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 41, but the smallest x in this case is 6, which is less than 16. The next prime, D, after 41 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is 61 and the least x for which it has a solution is 164, which is larger than 16, so it is a new record value. 29 is a term of A341083 and 16 is a term of this sequence, but 41 is not a term of A341083 because the least x for which x^2 - D*y^2 = -5 has a solution is not a record value."
