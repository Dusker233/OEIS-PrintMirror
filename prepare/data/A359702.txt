        "This sequence arises from a more general study. First, consider a function f : P -> N (where P is the set of the odd prime numbers) such that 0 <= f(p) < p. Then, remove from the set P each prime number q such that q = f(p) (mod p) for some p.",
        "For example, if f(p) = 0 for each p, then the final set is the empty set.",

        "If f(p) = p-1, then the final set seems to be the set of Mersenne primes (empirical observation).",
        "For the particular choice f(p) = 2k (where p is the k-th odd prime) this sequence is obtained."
