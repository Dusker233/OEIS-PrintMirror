        "The concept of the adjacency diagram in A220952 is not limited to base 5, but can be investigated for all odd bases. In \"base 1\", the path consists of a single node (1,1). For base 3, there is the ternary Gray code A128173 only. A corresponding simple up-down pattern with a path (0,0), ... (0,n), (1,n), ... (1,0), (2,0), ... (n,n) can be constructed for any odd base.",
