        "The terms of this sequence would remain unchanged if it were required that each value of xi (and hence each pairwise product xi*xj) be an integer, and the addition of such a constraint suggests a systematic (albeit impractical for larger values of n) way to search through sets of n values of x to find a set that yields each of the a(n) possible orderings of the pairwise products: for x1 = n, n+1, n+2, ..., test every combination of n distinct positive integers of which x1 is the largest. Let M(n) be the smallest integer such that each of the a(n) possible orderings results from at least one combination of integers x1, x2, ..., xn where M(n) >= x1 > x2 > ... > xn; then values of M(n) for n = 2..6 are 2, 5, 13, 29, and 68, respectively.",
        "For any given value of x1, the number of distinct orderings of pairwise products resulting from the binomial(x1-1, n-1) possible combinations of the remaining integers x2..xn provides a lower bound L(x1) for a(n). In general, L(x1) is not monotonically nondecreasing; e.g., for n=6, the (weak) lower bound on a(6)=2608 provided by L(33) is 2428, and L(34)=2423 is weaker still. However -- at least up through n=6 -- each of the a(n) possible orderings results from at least one combination where x1 is exactly M(n); e.g., at n=6, one of the 2608 orderings is missing among all binomial(67,6) = 99,795,696 combinations where x1 < 68, but all 2608 are present among the binomial(67,5) = 9,657,648 combinations where x1=68.",
        "For all n up to at least 6, the number of orderings found among all combinations where x1 < M(n) is a(n)-1, and the one missing ordering of the pairwise products is the one in which xj*xn > (x(j+1))^2 for j=1..n-1. (End)",
