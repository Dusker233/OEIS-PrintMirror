Moreover, for all regular primes p > 3 and integers k > 0, m = 2*p^k is the smallest index such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by p^k. Also, for all regular primes p > 3 and integers k > 0, all m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by p^k are of the form m = 2*s*p^k, where s > 0 is an integer."
