        "Equivalently, there is an edge between two nodes if the corresponding n-celled polyominoes can be obtained from the same (n-1)-celled polyomino by adding one cell.",
        "In the n-omino graph defined in A098891, the intermediate is not required to be a polyomino, so PG(n) is a spanning subgraph of that graph. For n = 5, for example, there is an edge between the V and W pentominoes in the graph in A098891, but not in PG(5)."
