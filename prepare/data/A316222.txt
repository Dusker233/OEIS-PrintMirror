    "comment": [
        "A positive subset-sum is a pair (h,g), where h is a positive integer and g is an integer partition, such that some submultiset of g sums to h. A triangle consists of a root sum r and a sequence of positive subset-sums ((h_1,g_1),...,(h_k,g_k)) such that the sequence (h_1,...,h_k) is weakly decreasing and has a submultiset summing to r."
