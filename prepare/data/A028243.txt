        "For n >= 3, a(n) is equal to the number of functions f: {1,2,...,n-1} -> {1,2,3} such that Im(f) contains 2 fixed elements. - Aleksandar M. Janjic and _Milan Janjic_, Mar 08 2007",

        "In the terdragon curve, a(n) is the number of triple-visited points in expansion level n.  The first differences of this sequence (A056182) are the number of enclosed unit triangles since on segment expansion each unit triangle forms a new triple-visited point, and existing triple-visited points are unchanged. - _Kevin Ryde_, Oct 20 2020",
        "a(n+1) is the number of ternary strings of length n that contain at least one 0 and one 1; for example, for n=3, a(4)=12 since the strings are the 3 permutations of 100, the 3 permutations of 110, and the 6 permutations of 210. - _Enrique Navarrete_, Aug 13 2021",

The signature of a 2n-tuple (v_1,...,v_{2n}) is the n-tuple (s_1,...,s_n) defined by s_i=v_i+v_{i+n}. The signature is called interlacing if after deleting the 1's, there are letters remaining and the remaining 0's and 2's are alternating. (End)",
