    "comment": [
        "The number of relations on n elements that are symmetric and transitive is the same as the number of equivalence relations on n+1 elements. Consequently, the number of relations that are transitive but not symmetric is obtained by subtracting the terms in the sequence of Bell numbers from that of the sequence of number of labeled transitive relations.",
