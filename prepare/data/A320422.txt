        "Sequence proposed by Thomas Young: draw the regular n-gon and construct n*(n-2) diagonals that run from each of the n vertices to the n-2 points in the middle of the opposite edges, where opposite edges are those not adjacent to the vertex. Count the non-overlapping polygons inside the n-gon which have sides that are sections of the diagonals or sections of the n-gon edges."
