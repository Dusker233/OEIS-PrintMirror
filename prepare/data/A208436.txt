For illustrative purposes, if o(1) is taken to be zero, it would suffice to check up to height 345.9 to verify a(24) with gap size 1.804... but over 10^10 for gap size 1. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 22 2012",

Hall & Hayman improve the above constant from 32 to Pi/2 + o(1). Even with this latter improvement, verifying a gap of size 1 with this formula (even dropping the o(1)) would take a height above 10^53. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jun 04 2021",
