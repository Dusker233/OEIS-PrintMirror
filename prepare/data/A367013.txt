        "If q is odd, then a(n) is the number of solutions to x^2 + y^2 = t in the finite field F_q for any t != 0.",
        "Proof: We first show that if x^2 + y^2 = t has a solution for t != 0, then the number of solutions is q - Kronecker(-4,q). Let (x_0,y_0) be a solution, then the other points on the circle x^2 + y^2 = t are parametrized by the lines through (x_0,y_0) with slope in F_q U {oo}. The line with slope k has an intersection with the circle other than (x_0,y_0) if and only if 1 + k^2 != 0 (in which case the intersection is the point at infinity) and k != -x_0/y_0 (in which case the line is tangent to the circle), so we have (q+1)-3 more solutions if q == 1 (mod 4) and (q+1)-1 more solutions if q == 3 (mod 4). By a simple counting argument we can see that x^2 + y^2 = t has a solution for all t != 0."
