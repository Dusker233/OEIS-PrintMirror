    "formula": [
        "a(n) = Sum_{i=1..n} ceiling(sqrt(n^2 - (i - 1/2)^2) - 1/2). Proof outline: consider an integer grid (i,j), e.g., a pixel image. A positive half circle hull's boundary of radius n contains all points ('pixels') where (i - 1/2)^2 + (j - 1/2)^2 = n^2 => j = f(j) = sqrt(n^2 - (i - 1/2)^2) + 1/2. To obtain the number of elements of the hull's closure without nonpositive points, count by upper Riemann sums with interval length 1: (n) = A(n) = Sum_{i=1..n} (ceiling(f(i)) - 1). ('i=1' discards the (0,j) points and '-1' cancels the (i,0) points.) - _Johannes Hoentsch_, Feb 26 2019"
