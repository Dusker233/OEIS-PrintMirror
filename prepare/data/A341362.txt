        "The Collatz function is as follows: F(x) = x/2 if x is even, otherwise F(x) = 3*x+1.",
        "It is conjectured that starting from any number, and repeatedly applying the function on its previous result, we will always reach 1.",
        "The d-value (or flight duration, A006577) is the number of steps needed to reach 1.  The h-value (or flight height, A025586) is the maximum of the number's trajectory."
