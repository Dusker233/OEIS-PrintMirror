        "Take a cycle graph which has two perfect matchings (PM), and add one PM that is disjoint to it. The number of possible PMs one can add is given by A003436. One ends up with a set of three disjoint perfect matchings (where disjoint means that each edge is an element of maximally one PM), but the graph will have more PMs. This sequence describes the minimal number of PMs that such a graph can have."
