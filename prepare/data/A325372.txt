        " A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. A number n is totally abnormal iff (1) the prime indices of n do not cover an initial interval of positive integers, and either (2a) n is prime, or (2b) the prime exponents (or prime signature) of n forms a totally abnormal integer partition, or, equivalently to (2b), A181819(n) is totally abnormal.",
