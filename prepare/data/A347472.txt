        "Related to Zarankiewicz's problem k_2(n) (cf. A001197 and other crossrefs) which asks the converse: how many 1's must be in an n X n {0,1}-matrix in order to guarantee the existence of an all-ones 2 X 2 submatrix. This complementarity leads to the given formula which was used to compute the given values.",

        "For n = 2, there must not be any nonzero entry in an n X n = 2 X 2 matrix, if one wants a 2 X 2 zero submatrix, whence a(2) = 0.",
        "For n = 3, having at most 2 nonzero entries in the n X n matrix still guarantees that there is a 2 X 2 zero submatrix (delete the row of the first nonzero entry and then the column of the remaining nonzero entry, if any), but if one allows 3 nonzero entries and they are placed on the diagonal, then there is no 2 X 2 zero submatrix. Hence, a(3) = 2."
