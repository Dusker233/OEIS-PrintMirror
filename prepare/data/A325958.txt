        "However, from a theoretical perspective if n is allowed to be 0, meaning that a 1 X 1 spiral can have corners, the formulas below that include A114254 might need reconsideration. With the current formula a(n) = 16*n^2 + 4*n + 4, a(0) = 4, meaning that a 1 X 1 spiral (with value 1) has 4 corners with value 1, giving sum 4. This might pave the way to a discussion, considered parallel with A114254. With the given equations, a 1 X 1 spiral happens to have a corner sum of 4. However, a 1 X 1 spiral has a diagonal sum of 1, from A114254. This seems as to be a contradiction; namely, the first term of A114254 should at least be 4 in this case, as corners constitute a subset of diagonal elements."
