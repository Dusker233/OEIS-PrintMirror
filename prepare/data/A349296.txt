        "a(n) is the number of ordered 6-tuples (a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6) having all terms in {1,...,n}, with at least one element equal to n, such that there exists a tetrahedron ABCD with those edge-lengths, taken in a particular order (see comments in A349295).",
        "Conjecture: for n tending to infinity the ratio from a(n) and the corresponding a(n) in A097125 tends to 24 as the probability that all a_i's are different tends to 1 and there are 24 6-tuples corresponding to the same tetrahedron if all a_i's are different. For n=254 the ratio is 23.9936919."
