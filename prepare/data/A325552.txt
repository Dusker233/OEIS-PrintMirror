        "A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n.",
        "The differences of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were increasing, so for example the differences of (3,1,2) are (-2,1).",
        "a(n) has the same parity as n for n > 0, since reversing a composition does not change whether or not it has this property, and the only valid symmetric compositions are (n) and (n/2,n/2), with the latter only existing for even n. - _Charlie Neder_, Jun 06 2019"
