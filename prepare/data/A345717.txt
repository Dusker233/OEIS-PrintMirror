    "comment": [
        "An abelian cube is a word of the form x x' x'', where x' and x'' are permutations of x, like the English word \"deeded\".  The order of an abelian cube is the length of x."

        "There is a deterministic finite automaton of 1169 states that takes n in its tribonacci representation as input and accepts if and only if there is an abelian cube of order n.  It can be obtained with the Walnut theorem-prover."
