        "If x is a Zumkeller number, then so is 2x. Conjecturally, if y is a term of this sequence, then so is 2y.",
        "If y is a term of this sequence, then so is p*y, where p is a prime that is coprime to y. Proof: Let D = {d_1,d_2,...,d_k} be the set of divisors of y. Let E be the set of divisors of p*y. Except for the divisors of y E contains their products with p. In other words, E = {d_1,d_2,...,d_2k}, meaning that the cardinality of E is twice the cardinality of D. Those additional divisors are F = {p*d_1,p*d_2,...,p*d_k}. Since D can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets with equal sums and cardinalities by definition, this must be true about F and also about E = D union F. QED. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Nov 20 2021"
