        "Next term contains a non-decimal character if such characters are chosen to represent digits > 9, where \"digit\" means the coefficients in N = Sum_{k>=0} d_k * b^k. This isn't possible here, but digits 0, 10, ..., 13 could be represented, e.g., using 00, 10, ..., 40. This would not affect a(0)..a(10), which don't have a digit 0. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 25 2018"
