    "comment": [
        "Consider the unlabeled, rooted, binary tree shapes (A001190). For each unlabeled shape, assign a labeling of the leaves: a labeled topology. This topology is a leaf-labeled, rooted, binary tree (chosen from among all such trees, A001147). From among the set of possible coalescence sequences (A006472), count all coalescence sequences, or labeled histories, that give rise to the specified labeled topology. For the unlabeled shape of size n whose labeled topologies have the largest number of coalescence sequences, the two subtrees immediately descended from the root have sizes a(n) and n-a(n) (Harding 1971, Eq. 5.7).",
