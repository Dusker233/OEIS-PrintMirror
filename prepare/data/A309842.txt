        "A cubic block is made of (n+2)^3 unit cubes, beginning with n=1. A hollow cubic block is a cubic block with all internal cubes removed (making its thickness 1), so its volume is (n+2)^3-n^3. The external edge length of a hollow cube is n+2, while the internal hollow volume edge length is n. The external surface area is 6*(n+2)^2 while the internal surface area is 6*n^2, therefore the total surface area is 6*(n+2)^2+6*n^2."
