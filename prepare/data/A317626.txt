        "In the first quadrant of a coordinate system define a rectangular Sophie Germain billiard table with width p and length 2p+1, with vertices (0,0), (p,0), (p,2p+1) and (0,2p+1). A billiard ball (considered to be a point) starts from (0,0) at an angle of 45 degrees and hits the sides exactly p times until it hits the x-axis. The sequence gives the intersections with the x-axis of consecutive Sophie Germain prime numbers (p > 3) after p bounces.",
        "The sum of all crossed lattice points (including the rectangle sides) is the sum of crossed points left under, right middle and left up respectively ((p+7)/6)^2 + (p+1)(p+4)/18 + (p+1)(p+7)/36 = ((p+4)/3)^2 (see bouncing examples).",
        "The enclosed areas in the Sophie Germain billiard table also correspond to ((p+4)/3)^2.",
        "The number of trajectories is a subsequence of A176045.",
        "The number of trajectories with slope +1 or with slope -1 is a subsequence of A124485.",
        "The sum of a term of this sequence and the corresponding Sophie Germain prime is A317510 and it appears that this is a subsequence of A179882. Checked up to and including 33295 of A317510 (Sophie Germain prime 24971)."
