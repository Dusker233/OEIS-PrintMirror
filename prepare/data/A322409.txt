        "(a(n+1)) = A319968(n)-1 = A003145(A003145(n))-1, the corresponding classical compound tribonacci sequence. - _Michel Dekking_, Apr 04 2019",
        "The nine sequences A308199, A319967, A319968, A322410, A322409,  A322411,  A322413, A322412, A322414 are based on defining the tribonacci ternary word to start with index 0 (in contrast to the usual definition, in A080843 and A092782, which starts with index 1). As a result these nine sequences differ from the compound tribonacci sequences defined in  A278040, A278041, and A319966-A319972. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 05 2019"
