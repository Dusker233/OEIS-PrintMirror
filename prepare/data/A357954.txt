        "Given the function A357143(k), a number k is a term of the sequence if there exists a j such that A357143^j(k) = k, where j is the number of iterations applied.",
        "The sequence is finite.",
        "Proof: A357143(k) < k for all big enough k. g(k) = A110592(k)*4^A110592(k) is clearly an upper bound of A357143(k). Hence k > g(k) -> k > A357143(k), therefore every periodic point must be in an interval [s;t] such that for every k in [s;t] k <= g(k). Limit_{k->oo} g(k)/k = 0; now using the little-o definition we can show that there always exists a certain k_0 such that, for every k > k_0, k > g(k). The conclusion is that there must exist a finite number of intervals [s;t] and, consequently, a finite number of periodic points.",
