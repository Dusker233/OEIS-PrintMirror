        "A Boolean relation matrix R is convergent iff R^k = R^(k+1) for all sufficiently large k.  In other words, iff the period of R is equal to 1.  The digraph of R is such that all its maximal cyclic nets are universal iff R is convergent.  Cf. Rosenblatt link.  Also, R is convergent iff every diagonal block in its Frobenius normal form is either primitive or a 1 X 1 zero matrix, Theorem 1.1 in Gregory, Kirkland and Pullman."
