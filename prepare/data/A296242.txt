        "Any repdigit number (A010785) is in the sequence; 2-digit numbers 10a + b are in the sequence iff |a - b| = 2 or 0. See examples for more explanations.",
        "The number 13 is the smallest prime for which the result of the \"slide\" operation yields a different prime, 31.",
        "Theorem: If a number n with L digits is in the sequence because it can produce a number m ending p places to the right of the original number, then a digit p can be prefixed or appended, and one also gets a term of the sequence as concatenate(L+1+p, n) and concatenate(n, L+1-p), provided that L+1+p < 10, resp. L+1-p >= 0. Similarly, if m ends p places to the left of n, with concatenate(L+1-p, n) resp. concatenate(n, L+1+p). [The latter could be included in the former case by taking p negative, but using the absolute value when p is to be concatenated.]",
        "Remark: Some repdigits d...d can \"reproduce\" less than d digits to the left or right: e.g., 2222 -> _2222 if all but the last 2's are moved two places to the right, but the last 2 is moved two places to the left.",
        "Not all terms of this sequence can be obtained starting from { 0, ..., 9 } and the construction given in the above Theorem, possibly keeping intermediate terms with leading zeros. The term a(123) = 1043 is the first counterexample.",

        "The number 13 is in the sequence because one can shift the digit 1 one place to the left, and the digit 3 two places to the left, resulting in the number 31__ (where the _ stands for empty places previously occupied by some digit).",
